The seizure of power by armed force, the settlement of the issue by war, is the central task and the highest form of revolution
According to the Marxist theory of the state, the army is the chief component of state power
Whoever wants to seize and retain state power must have a strong army
Some people ridicule us as advocates of the "omnipotence of war"
Yes, we are advocates of the omnipotence of revolutionary war; that is good, not bad, it is Marxist
We shall create a democratic republic
It is only by the power of the gun that the working class and the labouring masses can defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords 
We may say that only with guns can the whole world be transformed
The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism
If there is to be revolution, there must be a revolutionary party
Without a revolutionary party, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs
A revolutionary party: a party built on the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and in the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary style
Without a revolutionary party: a party built on the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious
If we doubt theparty built on the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and in the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary style , we shall accomplish nothing
No political party can possibly lead a great revolutionary movement to victory unless it possesses revolutionary theory
No political party can possibly lead a great revolutionary movement to victory unless it possesses a knowledge of history and 
No political party can possibly lead a great revolutionary movement to victory unless it has a profound grasp of the practical movement
Policy is the starting-point of all the practical actions of a revolutionary party 
Policy manifests itself in the process and the end-result of a revolutionary party's actions
A revolutionary party is carrying out a policy whenever it takes any action
If the revolutionary party is not carrying out a correct policy, it is carrying out a wrong policy
If the revolutionary party is not carrying out a given policy consciously, it is doing so blindly
What we call experience is the process and the end-result of carrying out a policy
Only through the practice of the people, that is, through experience, can we verify whether a policy is correct or wrong 
Only through the practice of the people can we determine to what extent a policy is correct or wrong
But people's practice, especially the practice of a revolutionary party and the revolutionary masses, cannot but be related to one policy or another
Classes struggle, some classes triumph, others are eliminated
Some classes triumph, others are eliminated; such is the history of civilization for thousands of years
To interpret history from this viewpoint is historical materialism; standing in opposition to this viewpoint is historical idealism
In class society everyone lives as a member of a particular class
In class society every kind of thinking, without exception, is stamped with the brand of a class
Changes in society are due chiefly to the development of the internal contradictions in society 
Changes in society are due chiefly to the contradiction between the productive forces and the relations of production
Changes in society are due chiefly to the contradiction between classes and the contradiction between the old and the new
It is the development of contradictions that pushes society forward 
It is the development of contradictions that gives the impetus for the supersession of the old society by the new
The ruthless economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasants by the landlord class forced them into numerous uprisings against its rule 
In the final analysis, national struggle is a matter of class struggle
Among the whites in the United States it is only the reactionary ruling circles who oppress the black people
The reactionary ruling circles can in no way represent the workers, farmers, revolutionary intellectuals 
The reactionary ruling circles can in no way represent the enlightened persons who comprise the overwhelming majority of the white people
It is up to us to organize the people
Everything reactionary is the same; if you don't hit it, it won't fall
It is like sweeping the floor; where the broom does not reach, the dust never vanishes of itself
The enemy will not perish of himself
A revolution is not a dinner party 
A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery; 
A revolution cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous
A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another
And we? Our policy is to give him tit for tat and to fight for every inch of land
Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of the first importance for the revolution
A revolutionary party is the guide of the masses, and no revolution ever succeeds when the revolutionary party leads them astray
To ensure that we will definitely achieve success in our revolution we must pay attention to uniting with our real friends 
To ensure that we will definitely achieve success in our revolution and will not lead the masses astray, we must attack our real enemies
Our enemies are all those in league with imperialism--the warlords, the bureaucrats, the comprador class, the big landlord class 
Our enemies are all those in league with imperialism--the reactionary section of the intelligentsia attached to them
The leading force in our revolution is the industrial proletariat
Our closest friends are the entire semi-proletariat and petty bourgeoisie
As for the vacillating middle bourgeoisie, their right-wing may become our enemy and their left-wing may become our friend
As for the vacillating middle bourgeoisie, we must be constantly on our guard and not let them create confusion within our ranks
Whoever sides with the revolutionary people is a revolutionary
Whoever sides with imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism is a counter-revolutionary
Whoever sides with the revolutionary people in words only but acts otherwise is a revolutionary in speech
Whoever sides with the revolutionary people in deed as well as in word is a revolutionary in the full sense
It is good if we are attacked by the enemy, since it proves that we have drawn a clear line of demarcation between the enemy and ourselves
If the enemy paints us as utterly black and without a single virtue it demonstrates that we have achieved a great deal in our work.
To Be Attacked by the Enemy Is Not a Bad Thing but a Good Thing 
We should support whatever the enemy opposes and oppose whatever the enemy supports
Our stand is that of the proletariat and of the masses
After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, there will still be enemies without guns
Enemies without guns are bound to struggle desperately against us; we must never regard these enemies lightly
The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will certainly not take their defeat lying down and they will struggle to the last ditch
The class struggle is by no means over
The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie will continue to be long and tortuous and at times even become very acute
The class struggle between the different political forces will continue to be long and tortuous and at times even become very acute
The class struggle in the ideological field between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie will continue to be long and tortuous 
The proletariat seeks to transform the world according to its own world outlook, and so does the bourgeoisie
In this respect, the question of which will win out, socialism or capitalism, is not really settled
It will take a fairly long period of time to decide the issue in the ideological struggle between socialism and capitalism in our country
The influence of the bourgeoisie and of the intellectuals who come from the old society will remain in our country for a long time to come
In our country bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology, anti-Marxist ideology, will continue to exist for a long time
Basically, the socialist system has been established in our country
We have won the basic victory in transforming the ownership of the means of production
we have not yet won complete victory on the political and ideological fronts
The question of who will win in the struggle between the proletariat or the bourgeoisie has not been really settled yet
We still have to wage a protracted struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology
It is wrong not to understand this and to give up ideological struggle
All erroneous ideas, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters, must be subjected to criticism; 
However, the criticism should be fully reasoned, analytical and convincing, and not rough, bureaucratic, metaphysical or dogmatic
Both dogmatism and revisionism run counter to Marxism
Marxism must certainly advance; it must develop along with practice and cannot stand still
Marxism would become lifeless if it remained stagnant and stereotyped
The basic principles of Marxism must never be violated, otherwise mistakes will be made
It is dogmatism to approach Marxism from a metaphysical point of view and to regard it as something rigid
It is revisionism to negate the basic principles of Marxism and to negate its universal truth
Revisionism is one form of bourgeois ideology
The revisionists deny the differences between socialism and capitalism
The revisionists deny the differences between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie
What they advocate is in fact not the socialist line but the capitalist line
One of our current important tasks on the ideological front is to unfold criticism of revisionism
Revisionism, or Right opportunism, is a bourgeois trend of thought that is even more dangerous than dogmatism
The revisionists, the Right opportunists, pay lip-service to Marxism; they too attack "dogmatism"
But what the revisionists are really attacking is the quintessence of Marxism
After the basic victory of the socialist revolution, there are still a number of people who vainly hope to restore the capitalist system
After the basic victory of the socialist revolution, there are still a number of people who fight the working class on every front
SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM Communism is at once a complete system of proletarian ideology and a new social system
Communism is different from any other ideology or social system
Communism is the most complete, progressive, revolutionary and rational system in human history
The ideological and social system of feudalism has a place only in the museum of history
The ideological and social system of capitalism has also become a museum piece 
The communist ideological and social system alone is full of youth and vitality
The communist ideological and social system alone is sweeping the world with the momentum of an avalanche and the force of a thunderbolt
The socialist system will eventually replace the capitalist system; this is an objective law independent of man's will
However much the reactionaries try to hold back the wheel of history, sooner or later revolution will take place and will triumph
In Celebration of the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution
We Communists never conceal our political views
The democratic revolution is the necessary preparation for the socialist revolution
The socialist revolution is the inevitable sequel to the democratic revolution
The ultimate aim for which all communists strive is to bring about a socialist and communist society
Socialist revolution aims at liberating the productive forces
The change-over from individual to socialist is bound to bring about a tremendous liberation of the productive forces
Thus the social conditions are being created for a tremendous expansion of industrial and agricultural production
We are now carrying out a revolution not only in the social system but also in technology and the two revolutions are interconnected
The new social system has only just been established and requires time for its consolidation
It must not be assumed that the new system can be completely consolidated the moment it is established, for that is impossible
To achieve its ultimate consolidation, it is necessary not only to bring about the socialist industrialization of the country
Persevere in the socialist revolution on the economic front
but also carry on constant and arduous socialist revolutionary struggles and socialist education on the political and ideological fronts
We can assuredly build a socialist state with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture
The number of intellectuals who are hostile to our state is very small
They do not like our state, ie the dictatorship of the proletariat, and yearn for the old society
as between the socialist and the capitalist roads, they stubbornly choose to follow the latter
The serious problem is the education of the peasantry
The peasant economy is scattered, and the socialization of agriculture will require a long time and painstaking work
Without socialization of agriculture, there can be no complete, consolidated socialism
The leading bodies in co-operatives must establish the dominant position of the poor peasants and the new lower middle peasants in these bodies
It is essential to unite with the middle peasants, and it is wrong not to do so
It is after they clearly see the approaching triumph of the revolution that the middle peasants will come in on the side of the revolution
The poor peasants must work on the middle peasants and win them over, so that the revolution will broaden 
There is a serious tendency towards capitalism among the well-to-do peasants
The agricultural co-operative movement has been a severe ideological and political struggle from the very beginning
No cooperative can be established without going through such a struggle
Before a brand-new social system can be built on the site of the old the site must be swept clean
Invariably, remnants of old ideas reflecting the old system remain in people's minds for a long time, and they do not easily give way
After a co-operative is established, it must go through many more struggles before it can be consolidated
The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years
On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production
Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulti
Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us
Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand firm in these circumstances? Obviously not
And that means to bring about the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts
By over-all planning we mean planning which takes into consideration the interests of the 600 million people of our country
More people mean a greater ferment of ideas, more enthusiasm and more energy
Never before have the masses of the people been so inspired, so militant and so daring as at present
Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, the desire for action and the desire for revolution
On a blank sheet of paper free from any mark, the freshest and most beautiful characters can be written
On a blank sheet of paper free from any mark, the freshest and most beautiful pictures can be painted
After victory state power of the people's republic under the leadership of the working class must not be weakened but must be strengthened
"Don't you want to abolish state power?" Yes, we do, but not right now; we cannot do it yet
Our present task is to strengthen the people's state apparatus in order to consolidate national defence and protect the people's interests
Our state is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance
What is this dictatorship for? Its first function is to suppress the reactionary classes and elements 
What is this dictatorship for? Its first function is to suppress those exploiters in our country who resist the socialist revolution
What is this dictatorship for? Its first function isto suppress those who try to wreck our socialist construction
What is this dictatorship for? Its first function is to resolve the internal contradictions between ourselves and the enemy
To arrest, try and sentence certain counter-revolutionaries--all this comes within the scope of our dictatorship
To deprive landlords and bureaucrat-capitalists of their right to vote--all this comes within the scope of our dictatorship
To deprive bureaucrat-capitalists of their freedom of speech for a specified period of time comes within the scope of our dictatorship
To safeguard the interests of the people, it is lnecessary to exercise dictatorship over scoundrels who seriously disrupt public order
The second function of this dictatorship is to protect our country from subversion and possible aggression by external enemies
The people's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class
For it is only the working class that is most far-sighted, most selfless and most thoroughly revolutionary
The entire history of revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class revolution fails 
The entire history of revolution proves that with the leadership of the working class revolution triumphs
Class struggle, the struggle for production and scientific experiment are the revolutionary movements for building a socialist country
Communists will be free from bureaucracy and immune against revisionism and dogmatism, and will for ever remain invincible
The proletariat will be able to unite with the broad working masses and realize a democratic dictatorship
The people's democratic dictatorship uses two methods
Towards the enemy, the people's democratic dictatorship uses the method of dictatorship
For as long a period of time as is necessary it does not let the enemy take part in political activities
For as long a period of time as is necessary it compels the enemy to obey the law of the People's Government and to engage in labour 
The people's democratic dictatorship compels the enemy through labour, to transform themselves into new men
Towards the people the people's democratic dictatorship uses the method not of compulsion but of democracy
Towards the people the people's democratic dictatorship lets them take part in political activities and does not compel them 
Towards the people the people's democratic dictatorship uses the method of democracy in educating and persuading them
Most arduous tasks lie ahead of us in the great work of construction
Our People's Government is one that genuinely represents the people's interests, it is a government that serves the people
Nevertheless, there are still certain contradictions between this government and the people
These include the contradictions between the interests of the state and the interests of the collective and the interests of the individual
These include the contradictions between democracy and centralism; between the leadership and the led;
These include the contradictions arising from the bureaucratic style of work of certain government workers 
Generally speaking, the people's basic identity of interests underlies the contradictions among the people
The contradictions between ourselves and the enemy are antagonistic contradictions
Within the ranks of the people, the contradictions among the working people are non-antagonistic
The contradictions between the exploited and the exploiting classes have a non-antagonistic in addition to an antagonistic aspect
In the political life of our people, how should right be distinguised from wrong in one's words and actions? 
Words and deeds should help to unite, and not divide, the people of all  our nationalities
Words and deeds should be beneficial, and not harmful, to socialist transformation  and socialist construction
Words and deeds should help to consolidate, and not undermine or weaken, the people's  democratic dictatorship
Words and deeds should help to consolidate, and not undermine or weaken, democratic  centralism
Words and deeds should be beneficial, and not harmful, to international socialist  unity 
Words and deeds should be beneficial, and not harmful, to the unity of the peace-loving people of the world
The question of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is one of a struggle between ourselves and the enemy
Those with a Rightist way of thinking make no distinction between ourselves and the enemy and take the enemy for our own people
Those with a Rightist way of thinking regard as friends the very persons whom the masses regard as enemies
Those with a "Left" deviation in their thinking magnify contradictions between ourselves and the enemy 
Those with a "Left" deviation in their thinking take certain contradictions among the people for contradictions with the enemy
Those with a "Left" deviation in their thinking regard as counter-revolutionaries persons who are actually not counter-revolutionaries
Qualitatively different contradictions can only be resolved by qualitatively different methods
The principle of using different methods to resolve different contradictions is one which Marxist-Leninists must strictly observe
The contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and the contradictions among the people must be resolved by different methods
It is, of course, true that the distinction between ourselves and the enemy is also one of right and wrong
The question of who is in the right, we or the reactionaries, is in a different category from questions of right and wrong among the people
The only way to settle questions of an ideological nature or controversial issues among the people is by the democratic method 
Settle issues by the method of discussion, criticism, persuasion and education, and not by the method of coercion or repression
To be able to arrange their lives properly, the people want their government to issue appropriate orders of an obligatory nature
It is common sense that the maintenance of public order would be impossible without adminstrative regulations
Administrative orders and the method of persuasion and education complement each other in resolving contradictions among the people
Even administrative regulations for the maintenance of public order must be accompanied by persuasion and education
In many cases regulations alone will not work
Inevitably, the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie will give expression to their own ideologies
Inevitably, the bourgeoisie will stubbornly express themselves on political and ideological questions by every possible means.
We should not use the method of suppression and prevent the bourgeoisie from expressing themselves
We should argue with the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie and direct appropriate criticism at them
We must undoubtedly criticize wrong ideas of every description
It would not be right to refrain from criticism, look on while wrong ideas spread unchecked and allow them to monopolize the field
Mistakes must be criticized and poisonous weeds fought wherever they crop up
Criticism should not be dogmatic, and the metaphysical method should not be used, but instead apply the dialectical method
What is needed is scientific analysis and convincing argument
To criticize the people's shortcomings is necessary, but in doing so we must truly take the stand of the people 
To criticize the people's shortcomings is necessary, but in doing so we must speak out of whole-hearted eagerness to protect and educate them
To treat comrades like enemies is to go over to the stand of the enemy
Contradiction and struggle are universal and absolute
The methods of resolving contradictions differ according to the differences in the nature of the contradictions
Some contradictions are characterized by open antagonism, others are not
Some contradictions which were originally non-antagonistic develop into antagonistic ones
In ordinary circumstances, contradictions among the people are not antagonistic
But if contradictions among the people are not handled properly, antagonism may arise
If we relax our vigilance and lower our guard, antagonism may arise
In a socialist country, the system of exploitation of man by man has been abolished and the interests of the people are basically the same
In our country, the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie belongs to the category of contradictions among the people
Exploitation of the working class for profit constitutes one side of the character of the bourgeoisie
Bourgeoisie support of the Constitution and willingness to accept socialist transformation constitute the other side of its character
The national bourgeoisie differs from the imperialists, the landlords and the bureaucrat-capitalists
The contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class is one between exploiter and exploited
The lesson of the Hungarian incident merits attention
War is the highest form of struggle for resolving contradictions, when they have developed to a certain stage
War is the highest form of struggle for resolving contradictions between classes, nations, states, or political groups
War has existed ever since the emergence of private property and of classes
Unless you understand the actual circumstances of war, you will not know how to direct war, or be able to win victory
War is the continuation of politics
War is politics and war itself is a political action; 
Since ancient times there has never been a war that did not have a political character 
War has its own particular characteristics and in this sense it cannot be equated with politics in general
War is the continuation of politics by other means
When politics develops to a certain stage beyond which it cannot proceed, war breaks out to sweep the obstacles from the way 
When the obstacle is removed and our political aim attained, the war will stop
If the obstacle is not completely swept away, the war will have to continue till the aim is fully accomplished 
Politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed
History shows that wars are divided into two kinds, just and unjust
All wars that are progressive are just, and all wars that impede progress are unjust
We Communists oppose all unjust wars that impede progress, but we do not oppose progressive, just wars
Not only do we Communists not oppose just wars, we actively participate in them
As for unjust wars, the Communists of the whole world firmly opposed that war
The way to oppose a war is to do everything possible to prevent it before it breaks out 
Once war breaks out, oppose war with war, oppose unjust war with just war, whenever possible
Revolutions and revolutionary wars are inevitable in class society 
Without revolutionary wars, it is impossible to accomplish any leap in social development 
Without revolutionary wars, it is impossible to overthrow the reactionary ruling classes 
Without revolutionary wars, it is impossible for the people to win political power
Revolutionary war is an antitoxin which not only eliminates the enemy's poison but also purges us of our own filth
Every just, revolutionary war is endowed with tremendous power, which can transform many things or clear the way for their transformation
Every Communist must grasp the truth, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun
The seizure of power by armed force, the settlement of the issue by war, is the central task and the highest form of revolution
According to the Marxist theory of the state, the army is the chief component of state power
Whoever wants to seize and retain state power must have a strong army
Some people ridicule us as advocates of the "omnipotence of war;"Yes, we are advocates of the omnipotence of revolutionary war
Yes, we are advocates of the omnipotence of revolutionary war; that is good, not bad, it is Marxist
We shall create a democratic republic
In the era of imperialism it is only by the power of the gun that the working class can defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords 
Only with guns can the whole world be transformed
We are advocates of the abolition of war, we do not want war; but war can only be abolished through war 
In order to get rid of the gun it is necessary to take up the gun
War, this monster of mutual slaughter among men, will be finally eliminated by the progress of human society
But there is only one way to eliminate war and that is to oppose war with war, to oppose counter-revolutionary war with revolutionary war
Oppose national counter-revolutionary war with national revolutionary war
Oppose counter-revolutionary class war with revolutionary class war 
When human society advances to the point where classes and states are eliminated, there will be no more wars
When human society advances to the point where classes and states are eliminated, that will be the era of perpetual peace for mankind
Our study of the laws of revolutionary war springs from the desire to eliminate all wars
Our country and all the other socialist countries want peace; so do the peoples of all the countries of the world
The only ones who crave war and do not want peace are certain monopoly capitalist groups in a handful of imperialist countries 
The only ones who crave war are certain monopoly capitalist groups which depend on aggression for their profits
To achieve a lasting world peace, we must further develop our friendship and co-operation with the fraternal countries in the socialist camp
To achieve a lasting world peace, we must strengthen our solidarity with all peace-loving countries
We must give active support to the national independence and liberation movement in countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America 
We must give active support to the peace movement and to just struggles in all the countries of the world
As for the imperialist countries, we should unite with their people and strive to coexist peacefully with those countries, 
As for the imperialist countries, under no circumstances should we harbour any unrealistic notions about them
We desire peace
If imperialism insists on fighting a war, we will have no alternative but to fight to the finish
If you are afraid of war day in day out, what will you do if war eventually comes? 
People all over the world are now discussing whether or not a third world war will break out
We stand firmly for peace and against war
If the imperialists insist on unleashing another war, we should not be afraid of it
Our attitude towards any disturbance: first, we are against it; second, we are not afraid of it
The First World War was followed by the birth of the Soviet Union with a population of 200 million
The Second World War was followed by the emergence of the socialist camp with a combined population of 900 million
If the imperialists insist on launching a third world war, it is certain that several hundred million more will turn to socialism
Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again; that is the logic of the reactionaries in dealing with the people's cause
When we say "imperialism is ferocious", we mean that its nature will never change
The imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives, they will never become Buddhas, till their doom
Fight, fail, fight again, fail again, fight again till their victory; that is the logic of the people
we must never relax our vigilance against the frenzied plots by the imperialists and their running dogs
Whoever relaxes vigilance will disarm himself politically and land himself in a passive position
The world is progressing, the future is bright and no one can change this general trend of history
We should carry on constant propaganda among the people on the facts of world progress 
We should carry on constant propaganda among the people on the bright future ahead so that they will build their confidence in victory
IMPERIALISM AND ALL REACTIONARIES ARE PAPER TIGERS; All reactionaries are paper tigers
In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality they are not so powerful
From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful
imperialism and all reactionaries have a dual nature -- they are real tigers and paper tigers at the same time
In past history, the slave-owning class, the feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie were vigorous, revolutionary and progressive
In past history, the slave-owning class, the feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie were real tigers
The proletariat became more and more formidable, these ruling classes changed into backward people, changed into paper tigers
These ruling classes eventually were overthrown, or will be overthrown, by the people
The reactionary, backward, decaying classes retained this dual nature even in their last life-and-death struggles against the people
The reactionary, backward, decaying classes were real tigers; they ate people, ate people by the millions and tens of millions
The cause of the people's struggle went through a period of difficulties and hardships, and along the path there were many twists and turns
Look! Were these not living tigers, iron tigers, real tigers? But in the end they changed into paper tigers, dead tigers, bean-curd tigers
These are historical facts
I have said that all allegedly powerful reactionaries are merely paper tigers;The reason is that they are divorced from the people
As we know, all allegedly powerful reactionaries were all overthrown
US imperialism has not yet been overthrown and it has the atom bomb;I believe it too will be overthrown;It, too, is a paper tiger
In the final analysis, the persecution of the revolutionary people only serves to accelerate the people's revolutions 
The United States has set up hundreds of military bases in many countries all over the world
The longer the US aggressors remain in those places, the tighter the nooses round their necks will become
Imperialism will not last long because it always does evil things
Imperialism persists in grooming and supporting reactionaries in all countries who are against the people
Imperialism has forcibly seized many colonies and semi-colonies and many military bases, and it threatens the peace with atomic war
Thus, forced by imperialism to do so, more than 90 per cent of the people of the world are rising or will rise up in struggle against it
Yet imperialism is still alive, still running amuck in Asia, Africa and Latin America
In the West imperialism is still oppressing the people at home;This situation must change
It is the task of the people of the whole world to put an end to the aggression and oppression perpetrated by US imperialism
Riding roughshod everywhere, US imperialism has made itself the enemy of the people of the world and has increasingly isolated itself
Those who refuse to be enslaved will never be cowed by the atom bombs and hydrogen bombs in the hands of the US imperialists
The raging tide of the people of the world against tile US aggressors is irresistible
86
If the US monopoly capitalist groups persist in pushing their policies of aggression and war, they will be hanged by the people
Strategically we should despise all our enemies, but tactically we should take them all seriously
We must despise the enemy with respect to the whole, but that we must take him seriously with respect to each and every concrete question
If we do not despise the enemy with respect to the whole, we shall be committing the error of opportunism
Marx and Engels were only two individuals, and yet in those early days they already declared that capitalism would be overthrown
But in dealing with concrete problems and particular enemies we shall be committing the error of adventurism unless we take them seriously
In war, battles can only be fought one by one and the enemy forces can only be destroyed one by one
Factories can only be built one by one;The peasants can only plough the land plot by plot;The same is even true of eating a meal
Strategically, we take the eating of a meal lightly;we know we can finish it;But actually we eat it mouthful by mouthful
It is impossible to swallow an entire banquet in one gulp;In military parlance, it is called wiping out the enemy forces one by one
It is my opinion that the international situation has now reached a new turning point
I believe it is characteristic of the situation today that the East Wind is prevailing over the West Wind
That is to say, the forces of socialism have become overwhelmingly superior to the forces of imperialism
DARE TO STRUGGLE AND DARE TO WIN   
People of the world, unite and defeat the US aggressors and all their running dogs! 
People of the world, be courageous, dare to fight, defy difficulties and advance wave upon wave
When the whole world will belong to the people;Monsters of all kinds shall be destroyed
All reactionary forces on the verge of extinction invariably conduct a last desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces
Some revolutionaries are failing to grasp the fact that the enemy is nearing extinction while they themselves are approaching victory
If they fight, we will wipe them out completely
This is the way things are: if they attack and we wipe them out, they will have that satisfaction; 
Wipe out some, some satisfaction; wipe out more, more satisfaction; wipe out the whole lot, complete satisfaction
If they start fighting, we fight back, fight to win peace
If anyone attacks us and if the conditions are favourable for battle we will certainly act in self-defence to wipe him out resolutely
We do not strike rashly, but when we do strike, we must win
We must never be cowed by the bluster of reactionaries
As far as our own desire is concerned, we don't want to fight even for a single day
But if circumstances force us to fight, we can fight to the finish
We are for peace;Not that we are warlike
We are willing to stop the war at once and leave the remaining questions for later settlement;But US imperialism is not willing to do so
All right then, let the fighting go on
We should rid our ranks of all impotent thinking
All views that overestimate the strength of the enemy and underestimate the strength of the people are wrong
The oppressed peoples and nations must not pin their hopes for liberation on the "sensibleness" of imperialism and its lackeys
They will only triumph by strengthening their unity and persevering in their struggle
No matter when this country-wide civil war breaks out, we must be well prepared
In the present international situation it is possible that for a time the civil war may be kept restricted in scale and localized
In short, we must be prepared;Being prepared, we shall be able to deal properly with all kinds of complicated situations
PEOPLE'S WAR   The revolutionary war is a war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them 
What is a true bastion of iron? It is the masses, the millions upon millions of people who genuinely and sincerely support the revolution
It is the masses;That is the real iron bastion which no force can smash, no force whatsoever
The counter-revolution cannot smash us; on the contrary, we shall smash it
The richest source of power to wage war lies in the masses of the people
The imperialists are bullying us in such a way that we will have to deal with them seriously
Not only must we have a powerful regular army, we must also organize contingents of the people's militia on a big scale
The operations of the people's guerrillas and those of the main forces of the Red Army complement each other;
If we had only the main forces of the Red Army without the people's guerrillas, we would be like a warrior with only one arm
Unquestionably, victory or defeat in war is determined mainly by the military, political, economic and natural conditions on both sides
Victory or defeat in war is also determined by each side's subjective ability in directing the war
In his endeavour to win a war, a military man cannot overstep the limitations imposed by the material conditions;
The stage of action for a military man is built upon objective material conditions
The object of war is specifically "to preserve oneself and destroy the enemy" 
To destroy the enemy means to disarm him or "deprive him of the power to resist",
To destroy the enemy does not mean to destroy every member of his forces physically
To the present day, all weapons are still an extension of the spear and the shield
The bomber, the machine-gun, the long-range gun and poison gas are developments of the spear
The air-raid shelter, the steel helmet, the concrete fortification and the gas mask are developments of the shield
The tank is a new weapon combining the functions of both spear and shield
Attack is the chief means of destroying the enemy, but defence cannot be dispensed with
In attack the immediate object is to destroy the enemy, but at the same time it is self-preservation
If the enemy is not destroyed, you will be destroyed
In defence the immediate object is to preserve yourself
Defence is a means of supplementing attack or preparing to go over to the attack
Retreat is in the category of defence and is a continuation of defence, while pursuit is a continuation of attack
It should be pointed out that destruction of the enemy is the primary object of war and self-preservation the secondary,
Only by destroying the enemy in large numbers can one effectively preserve oneself
Therefore attack, the chief means of destroying the enemy, is primary, while defence, a supplementary means of destroying the enemy and a means of self-preservation, is secondary
In actual warfare the chief role is played by defence much of the time and by attack for the rest of the time
If war is taken as a whole, attack remains primary
All the guiding principles of military operations grow out of the one basic principle 
Strive to the utmost to preserve one's own strength and destroy that of the enemy;
How then do we justify the encouragement of heroic sacrifice in war? Every war exacts a price, sometimes an extremely high one
To put it more exactly; sacrifice and self-preservation are both opposite and complementary to each other
The principle of preserving oneself and destroying the enemy is the basis of all military principles
Our principles of operation are: Attack dispersed, isolated enemy forces first; attack concentrated, strong  enemy forces later
Our principles of operation are: Take small and medium cities and extensive rural areas first; take big  cities later
Make wiping out the enemy's effective strength our main objective; do  not make holding or seizing a city or place our main objective
Holding or  seizing a city or place is the outcome of wiping out the enemy's effective  strength
Often a city or place can be held or seized for good only after  it has changed hands a number of times
In every battle, concentrate an absolutely superior force,encircle the enemy forces completely, strive to wipe them out thoroughly 
In special circumstances, use the method of dealing crushing blows to the enemy
Concentrate all our strength to make a frontal attack and also to attack one or both of his flanks, with the aim of wiping out one part
Strive to avoid battles of attrition  in which we lose more than we gain or only break even
Avoid battles of attrition, although  we are inferior as a whole, we are absolutely superior in every part and every specific campaign
As time goes on, we shall become superior as a whole and eventually  wipe out all the enemy
Fight no battle unprepared, fight no battle you are not sure of winning  
Make every effort to be well prepared for each battle, make every effort  to ensure victory in the given set of conditions
Give full play to our style of fighting -- courage in battle, no fear of sacrifice, no fear of fatigue, and continuous fighting 
Strive to wipe out the enemy through mobile warfare
Pay attention to the tactics of positional attack and capture enemy fortified  points and cities
With regard to attacking cities, resolutely seize all enemy fortified  points and cities which are weakly defended
Seize at opportune moments all enemy fortified points and cities defended with moderate strength, provided circumstances permit
As for strongly defended enemy fortified points and cities, wait till conditions are ripe and then take them
Replenish our strength with all the arms and most of the personnel captured  from the enemy
Make good use of the intervals between campaigns to rest, train and  consolidate our troops
Periods of rest, training and consolidation should  in general not be very long
The enemy should so far as possible be permitted  no breathing space
Our strategy and tactics are based on a people's war; no army opposed to the people can use our strategy and tactics
Without preparedness superiority is not real superiority and there can be no initiative either
A force which is inferior but prepared can often defeat a superior enemy by surprise attack
THE PEOPLE'S ARMY   Without a people's army the people have nothing
THE PEOPLE'S army is powerful because all its members have a discipline based on political consciousness
THE PEOPLE'S ARMY fight not for the private interests of a few individuals or a narrow clique, but for the interests of the whole nation
The Red Army fights not merely for the sake of fighting but in order to conduct propaganda among the masses 
The Red Army fights to organize the masses, arm them, and help them to establish revolutionary political power
The People's Liberation Army is always a fighting force
We have an army for fighting as well as an army for labour
Our national defence will be consolidated and no imperialist will be allowed to invade our territory again
Our people's armed forces must be maintained and developed with the brave and steeled People's Liberation Army as their foundation
We will have not only a powerful army but also a powerful air force and a powerful navy
We must take care that neither collective leadership nor personal responsibility is overemphasized to the neglect of the other
In the army, the person in command has the right to make emergency decisions during battle and when circumstances require
It is indeed not easy to lead this squad well
Each bureau or sub-bureau of the Central Committee now leads a vast area and shoulders very heavy responsibilities
To lead means not only to decide general and specific policies but also to devise correct methods of work
Even with correct general and specific policies, troubles may still arise if methods of work are neglected
To be a good "squad leader", the secretary should study hard and investigate thoroughly
A secretary or deputy secretary will find it difficult to direct his "squad" well if he does not take care to do propaganda
If the "squad members" do not march in step, they can never expect to lead tens of millions of people in fighting and construction
Place problems on the table
Do not talk behind people's backs
Whenever problems arise, call a meeting, place the problems on the table for discussion, take some decisions 
If problems exist and are not placed on the table, they will remain unsolved for a long time and even drag on for years
The "squad leader" and the committee members should show understanding in their relations with each other
Exchange information;This is of great importance in achieving a common language
Ask your subordinates about matters you don't understand or don't know, and do not lightly express your approval or disapproval 
We should never pretend to know what we don't know, we should "not feel ashamed to ask and learn from people below" 
We should listen carefully to the views of the cadres at the lower levels
Be a pupil before you become a teacher; learn from the cadres at the lower levels before you issue orders 
What the cadres at the lower levels say may or may not be correct; we must analyse it
We must heed the correct views and act upon them 
Listen also to the mistaken views from below; it is wrong not to listen to them at all
Mistaken views from below, however, are not to be acted upon but to be criticized
Learn to "play the piano;In playing the piano all ten fingers are in motion; it won't do to move some fingers only and not others
To produce good music, the ten fingers should move rhythmically and in co-ordination
At present, we have to take care of many fields; we must look after the work in all the areas, armed units and departments, 
We must not give all our attention to a few problems, to the exclusion of others
Wherever there is a problem, we must put our finger on it, and this is a method we must master
Some play the piano well and some badly, and there is a great difference in the melodies they produce
One can get a grip on something only when it is grasped firmly, without the slightest slackening
Not to grasp firmly is not to grasp at all
Naturally, one cannot get a grip on something with an open hand
When the hand is clenched as if grasping something but is not clenched tightly, there is still no grip
Some of our comrades do grasp the main tasks, but their grasp is not firm and so they cannot make a success of their work
It will not do to have no grasp at all, nor will it do if the grasp is not firm
Have a head for figures
We must attend to the quantitative aspect of a situation or problem and make a basic quantitative analysis
Every quality manifests itself in a certain quantity, and without quantity there can be no quality
To this day many of our comrades still do not understand that they must attend to the quantitative aspect of things
They have no "figures" in their heads and as a result cannot help making mistakes
Notice of meetings should be given beforehand; this is like issuing a "Notice to Reassure the Public", 
In some places, meetings of cadres are called without first preparing reports and draft resolutions
Don't call a meeting in a hurry if the preparations are not completed
Fewer and better troops and simpler administration
Talks, speeches, articles and resolutions should all be concise and to the point
Meetings also should not go on too long
Pay attention to uniting and working with comrades who differ with you
We should be good at uniting in our work not only with comrades who hold the same views as we but also with those who hold different views
Guard against arrogance
Even those who have made no serious mistakes and have achieved very great success in their work should not be arrogant
Within the revolutionary ranks, it is necessary to make a clear distinction between right and wrong
Within the revolutionary ranks, it is necessary to make a clear distinction between achievements and shortcomings 
Do the achievements amount to 30 per cent or to 70 per cent of the whole? It will not do either to understate or to overstate
If his achievements amount to 70 per cent of the whole, then his work should in the main be approved
It would be entirely wrong to describe work in which the achievements are primary as work in which the mistakes are primary
In our approach to problems we must not forget to draw these two lines of distinction, between revolution and counter-revolution
In our approach to problems we must not forget to draw these two lines of distinction, between achievements and shortcomings
Our attitude towards every person and every matter should be one of analysis and study
In the sphere of organization, ensure democracy under centralized guidance
The higher bodies must be familiar with the life of the masses and wit hthe situation in the lower bodies
Once a decision is reached, it must be firmly carried out
THE MASS LINE   The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history
The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant
The masses have boundless creative power
They can organize themselves and concentrate on places and branches of work where they can give full play to their energy; 
They can concentrate on production in breadth and depth and create more and more undertakings for their own well-being
The present upsurge of the peasant movement is a colossal event
They will smash all the trammels that bind them and rush forward along the road to liberation
They will sweep all the imperialists, warlords, corrupt officials, local tyrants and evil gentry into their graves
Every revolutionary party and every revolutionary comrade will be put to the test, to be accepted or rejected as they decide
It is a vast socialist revolutionary movement and it has extremely great and world-wide significance
We should give this movement active, enthusiastic and systematic leadership, and not drag it back by one means or another
Some errors are unavoidable in the process; this is understandable, and they will not be hard to correct
Shortcomings or mistakes among cadres and peasants can be remedied or overcome provided we give them positive help
The masses have a potentially inexhaustible enthusiasm for socialism
Those who can only follow the old routine in a revolutionary period are utterly incapable of seeing this enthusiasm
Those who can only follow the old routine in a revolutionary period are blind and all is dark ahead of them
At times they go so far as to confound right and wrong and turn things upside down
Haven't we come across enough persons of this type? Those who simply follow the old routine invariably underestimate the people's enthusiasm
We have always maintained that the revolution must rely on the masses of the people, on everybody's taking a hand
We have always maintained that the revolution must rely on the masses and have opposed relying merely on a few persons issuing orders
The mass line, however, is still not being thoroughly carried out in the work of some comrades
They still rely solely on a handful of people working coolly and quietly by themselves
They are always reluctant to explain it to the people they lead
They do not understand why or how to give play to the initiative and creative energy of those they lead
Subjectively, they too want everyone to take a hand in the work, but they do not let other people know what is to be done or how to do it
carry out ideological education on the mass line, but at the same time we must teach these comrades many concrete methods of work
The right task, policy and style of work invariably conform with the demands of the masses and invariably strengthen our ties with them
The wrong task, policy and style of work invariably disagree with the demands of the masses and invariably alienate us from the masses
To link oneself with the masses, one must act in accordance with the needs and wishes of the masses
All work done for the masses must start from their needs and not from the desire of any individual, however well-intentioned
It often happens that objectively the masses need a certain change, but subjectively they are not yet conscious of the need
It often happens that objectively the masses need a certain change, but subjectively they are not yet willing or to make the change
In such cases, we should wait patiently
We should not make the change until, through our work, most of the masses have become conscious of the need and are willing to carry it out
Unless they are conscious and willing, any kind of work that requires their participation will turn out to be a mere formality and will fail 
It should teach every comrade to love the people and listen attentively to the voice of the masses; 
It should teach every comrade to identify himself with the masses wherever he goes and, instead of standing above them, to immerse himself among them; 
It should teach every comrade to instead of standing above the masses, to immerse himself among them; 
If we tried to go on the offensive when the masses are not yet awakened, that would be adventurism
If we insisted on leading the masses to do anything against their will, we would certainly fail
If we did not advance when the masses demand advance, that would be Right opportunism
Our comrades must not assume that everything they themselves understand is understood by the masses
Whether the masses understand it and are ready to take action can be discovered only by going into their midst and making investigations
Violating the principle of voluntary mass action reflects the disease of impetuosity
Violating the principle of leading the masses forward reflects the disease of dilatoriness
Our comrades must not assume that the masses have no understanding of what they themselves do not yet understand
The masses outstrip us and are eager to advance a step when our comrades are still tailing behind certain backward elements
Take the ideas of the masses and concentrate them, then got to the masses, persevere in the ideas and carry them through
Take the ideas of the masses (scattered and unsystematic ideas) and concentrate them 
In an endless spiral, with the ideas becoming more correct, more vital and richer each time.Such is the Marxist theory of knowledge
We should go to the masses and learn from them, synthesize their experience into better, articulated principles and methods
Do propaganda among the masses, so as to solve their problems and help them achieve liberation and happiness
In all mass movements we must make a basic investigation and analysis of the number of active supporters, opponents and neutrals 
In all mass movements we must not decide problems subjectively and without basis
The masses in any given place are generally composed of three parts, the relatively active, the intermediate and the relatively backward
Leaders must be skilled in uniting the small number of active elements around the leadership and must rely on them 
However active the leading group may be, it will amount to fruitless effort by a handful of people unless combined with the masses
Without a strong leading group, such activity cannot be sustained for long, or carried forward in the right direction
The interests of the masses, the experiences and feelings of the masses -- to these the leading cadres should pay constant attention
We should pay close attention to the well-being of the masses, from the problems of land and labour to those of fuel and salt
All such problems concerning the well-being of the masses should be placed on our agenda
We should discuss all problems, adopt and carry out decisions and check up on the results
We should help the masses to realize that we represent their interests, that our lives are intimately bound up with theirs
Political work is the life-blood of all economic work
This is particularly true at a time when the social and economic system is undergoing fundamental change
Our victory depends not only upon our military operations but also upon the disintegration of the enemy troops
Not to have a correct political orientation is like having no soul
Both students and intellectuals should study hard
Students and intellectuals must make progress ideologically and politically, which means they should study Marxism
All departments and organizations should shoulder their responsibilities for ideological and political work
First, we must be ruthless to our enemies, we must overpower and annihilate them
Second, we must be kind to our own, to the people, to our comrades and to our superiors and subordinates, and unite with them
We hail from all corners of the country and have joined together for a common revolutionary objective
And we need the vast majority of the people with us on the road to this objective
All people in the revolutionary ranks must care for each other, must love and help each other
Communists must use the democratic method of persuasion and education when working among the labouring people
Communists must use the democratic method of persuasion and must on no account resort to commandism or coercion
Persuasion, not coercion, is the only way to convince people
Our comrades must understand that ideological remoulding involves long-term, patient and painstaking work, 
Our comrades must not attempt to change people's ideology, which has been shaped over decades of life, by giving a few lectures 
Coercion will never result in convincing people
To try to convince them submit by force simply won't do
We must make a distinction between the enemy and ourselves
We must not adopt an antagonistic stand towards comrades and treat them as we would the enemy
In speaking up, one must have an ardent desire to protect the cause of the people and raise their political consciousness
In speaking up, there must be no ridiculing or attacking in one's approach
The army must become one with the people so that they see it as their own army Such an army will be invincible 
We must unite with the masses; the more of the masses we unite with, the better
Wherever our comrades go, they must build good relations with the masses, be concerned for them and help them overcome their difficulties
Leaders at all levels have the duty to listen to others
Say all you know and say it without reserve; Don't blame the speaker but take his words as a warning
In the sphere of theory, destroy the roots of ultra-democracy
The source of ultra-democracy consists in the petty bourgeoisie's individualistic aversion to discipline
Ultra-democracy :These ideas are utterly incompatible with the fighting tasks of the proletariat
The "Three Improvements" meant organizational consolidation, ideological education and rectification of style of work
Our educational policy must enable everyone who receives an education to develop morally, intellectually and physically 
Our educational policy must enable everyone to become a worker with both socialist consciousness and culture
For a school, the most important question is the selection of a director and instructors and the adoption of an educational policy
A school of a hundred people certainly cannot be run well if it does not have a leading group of several people; 
All officers and fighters of our army must improve their military art, march forward courageously towards sure victory in the war 
All officers and fighters of our army must resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and completely wipe out all enemies
Our slogan in training troops is, "Officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers and soldiers teach each other"
The officers should learn from the fighters, and when they have made other people's experience their own, they will become more capable
The fighters have a lot of practical combat experience
We should unfold the mass training movement in which officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers and the soldiers teach each other
The organs of state must practise democratic centralism, they must rely on the masses and their personnel must serve the people
Every Communist must learn from him his utter devotion to others without any thought of self,his great sense of responsibility in his work
We must all learn the spirit of absolute selflessness from him
These battalions of ours are wholly dedicated to the liberation of the people and work entirely in the people's interests
All our cadres, whatever their rank, are servants of the people, and whatever we do is to serve the people
Our duty is to hold ourselves responsible to the people
Wherever there is struggle there is sacrifice, and death is a common occurrence
We have the interests of the people and the sufferings of the great majority at heart, and when we die for the people it is a worthy death
Nevertheless, we should do our best to avoid unnecessary sacrifices
All men must die, but death can vary in its significance
To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai, but die for the exploiters and oppressors is lighter than a feather
The specific content of patriotism is determined by historical conditions
Can a Communist, who is an internationalist, at the same time be a patriot? We hold that he not only can be but must be
We are at once internationalists and patriots, and our slogan is, Fight to defend the motherland against the aggressors
For us defeatism is a crime and to strive for victory in the War of Resistance is an inescapable duty
For only by fighting in defence of the motherland can we defeat the aggressors and achieve national liberation
Only by achieving national liberation will it be possible for the proletariat and other working people to achieve their own emancipation
In wars of national liberation patriotism is applied internationalism
This is our internationalism, the internationalism with which we oppose both narrow nationalism and narrow patriotism
In the fight for complete liberation the oppressed people rely first of all on their own struggle 
The people who have triumphed in their own revolution should help those still struggling for liberation;This is our internationalist duty
The socialist countries are states of an entirely new type in which the working people are in power
We are closely bound by common interests and common ideals
The people of the countries in the socialist camp should unite
The people of the countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America should unite
The people of all the continents should unite, all peace-loving countries should unite
All countries subjected to US aggression, control, intervention or bullying should unite, 
Form the broadest united front to oppose the US imperialist policies of aggression and war and to defend world peace
However, we should be modest -- not only now, but forty-five years hence as well;We should always be modest
We must never adopt an arrogant attitude and become conceited because of the victory of our revolution
Every nation, big or small, has its strong and weak points
This army has an indomitable spirit and is determined to vanquish all enemies and never to yield
No matter what the difficulties and hardships, so long as a single man remains, he will fight on
Give full play to our style of fighting -- courage in battle, no fear of sacrifice, no fear of fatigue, and continuous fighting
Be resolute, fear no sacrifice and surmount every difficulty to win victory
They picked themselves up, wiped off the blood, buried their fallen comrades and went into battle again
You have many good qualities and have rendered great service, but you must always remember not to become conceited
You are respected by all, and quite rightly, but this easily leads to conceit
If you become conceited, if you are not modest and cease to exert yourselves, then you will cease to be heroes and models
If you become conceited, if you do not respect the cadres and the masses, then you will cease to be heroes and models
There have been such conceited people in the past, and I hope you will not follow their example
In the fight to wipe out the enemy, you have overcome many difficulties and demonstrated immense courage, wisdom and initiative
BUILDING OUR COUNTRY THROUGH DILIGENCE AND FRUGALITY   W
Diligence and thrift should be practiced in running factories, shops and all state-owned, co-operative and other enterprises
The principle of diligence and frugality should be observed in everything
The principle of economy is one of the basic principles of socialist economics
Even then we still have to observe the principle of diligence and frugality
Wherever we happen to be, we must treasure our manpower and material resources
We must not take a short view and indulge in wastefulness and extravagance
To cross the threshold is not difficult and mastery, too, is possible provided one sets one's mind to the task and is good at learning
We must learn to do economic work from all who know how, no matter who they are
We must esteem  all who know how  as teachers, learning from them respectfully and conscientiously
We must not pretend to know when we do not know
Knowledge is a matter of science, and no dishonesty or conceit whatsoever is permissible
What is required is definitely the reverse--honesty and modesty
Complacency is the enemy of study
We cannot really learn anything until we rid ourselves of complacency
Our attitude towards ourselves should be "to be insatiable in learning" and towards others "to be tireless in teaching"
Some people have read a few Marxist books and think themselves quite learned, but what they have read has not penetrated
It has not struck root in their minds, so that they do not know how to use it and their class feelings remain as of old
They waver while the latter stand firm, they equivocate while the latter are forthright
By saying that civilians can very quickly become soldiers, we mean that it is not difficult to cross the threshold
In order to have a real grasp of Marxism, one must learn it not only from books, but chiefly through class struggle, 
In order to have a real grasp of Marxism, one must learn it not only from books, but chiefly through practical work 
In order to have a real grasp of Marxism, one must learn it chiefly through close contact with the masses of workers
If you can apply the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint in elucidating one or two practical problems, you should be commended
If you can apply the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint in elucidating practical problems, you should be be credited with some achievement
It is necessary to master Marxist theory and apply it, master it for the sole purpose of applying it
The theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin is universally applicable;We should regard it not as a dogma, but as a guide to action
Studying it is not merely a matter of learning terms and phrases but of learning Marxism-Leninism as the science of revolution
If we have a correct theory but merely prate about it and do not put it into practice, then that theory, however good, is of no significance
Letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend is the policy for flourishing socialist culture in our land
Works of art which lack artistic quality have no force, however progressive they are politically
But all classes in all class societies invariably put the political criterion first and the artistic criterion second
There is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake, art that stands above classes or art that is detached from or independent of politics
In the world today all culture, all literature and art belong to definite classes and are geared to definite political lines
Men and women must received equal pay for equal work in production
Genuine equality between the sexes can only be realized in the process of the socialist transformation of society as a whole
It has become necessary to arouse the great mass of women who did not work in the fields before to take their place on the labour front
Enable every woman who can work to take her place on the labour front, under the principle of equal pay for equal work
In a word, the whole feudal-patriarchal system and ideology is tottering with the growth of the peasants' power
The political authority of the landlords is the backbone of all the other systems of authority
With that overturned, the clan authority, the religious authority and the authority of the husband all begin to totter
Our hope is placed on you
The world belongs to you
The establishment of our socialist system has opened the road leading to the ideal society of the future
Cadres, new and old, should respect each other, learn from each other and overcome their own shortcomings 
The world is yours, as well as ours, but in the last analysis, it is yours
You young people, full of vigour and vitality, are in the bloom of life, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning
Learn from each other's strong points, so as to unite as one in the common cause and guard against sectarian tendencies
The strong point of the new cadres, as Stalin has said, is that they are acutely sensitive to what is new 
The strong point of the new cadres, as Stalin has said, is that they are enthusiastic and active to a high degree
We must know how to take good care of cadres;First, give them guidance;Second, raise their level
Educate them by giving them the opportunity to study so that they can enhance their theoretical understanding and their working ability
Check up on their work, and help them sum up their experience, carry forward their achievements and correct their mistakes
To assign work without checking up and to take notice only when serious mistakes are made--that  is not the way to take care of cadres
In general, use the method of persuasion with cadres who have made  mistakes, and help them correct their mistakes
The method of struggle should be confined to those who make serious mistakes and nevertheless refuse to accept guidance
It is wrong lightly to label  people "opportunists" or lightly to begin "waging struggles" against them
When cadres are in difficulty as a result of domestic troubles, we must  be sure to give them as much care as possible
A leading group that is genuinely united and linked with the masses can gradually be formed only in the process of mass struggle
The unwholesome ideology of the old society, remnants of the ideology of petty-bourgeois individualism
All old cadres should welcome the new ones with the utmost enthusiasm and show them the warmest solicitude
Speak politely
Pay fairly for what you buy
Return everything you borrow
Pay for anything you damage
Do not hit or swear at people
Do not damage crops
Do not take liberties with women
Do not ill-treat captives
Thoroughgoing materialists are fearless; 
We hope that all our fellow fighters will courageously shoulder their responsibilities and overcome all difficulties
Fear no setbacks or gibes, nor hesitate to criticize us Communists and give us their suggestions
He who is not afraid of death by a thousand cuts dares to unhorse the emperor
We have the Marxist-Leninist weapon of criticism and self-criticism
We can get rid of a bad style and keep the good
As we say, dust will accumulate if a room is not cleaned regularly, our faces will get dirty if they are not washed regularly
Obey orders in all your actions
Don't take a single needle or piece of thread from the masses
Turn in everything captured
Within the ranks of the people, democracy is correlative with centralism and freedom with discipline
It is imperative to overcome anything that impairs the unity between officers and men
Liberalism is extremely harmful in a revolutionary collective
Liberalism is a corrosive which eats away unity, undermines cohesion, causes apathy and creates dissension
Liberalism is an extremely bad tendency
People who are liberals look upon the principles of Marxism as abstract dogma
People who are liberals approve of Marxism, but are not prepared to practice it or to practice it in full
People who are liberals are not prepared to replace their liberalism by Marxism
They talk Marxism but practice liberalism; they apply Marxism to others but liberalism to themselves
The people's state protects the people
To be aware of one's own mistakes and yet make no attempt to correct them, taking a liberal attitude towards oneself
Lack of achievement in work may breed pessimism and depression, while achievement may breed pride and arrogance
Modesty helps one to go forward, whereas conceit makes one lag behind
Even if we achieve gigantic successes in our work, there is no reason whatsoever to feel conceited and arrogant
We should always use our brains and think everything over carefully
A common saying goes, Knit the brows and you will hit upon a stratagem;In other words, much thinking yields wisdom
The present problem is that many people consider it impossible to accomplish things which could be accomplished if they exerted themselves
We must learn to look at problems all-sidedly, seeing the reverse as well as the obverse side of things
In given conditions, a bad thing can lead to good results and good thing to bad results
In approaching a problem a Marxist should see the whole as well as the parts
The analytical method is dialectical
By analysis, we mean analysing the contradictions in things
Sound analysis is impossible without intimate knowledge of life and without real understanding of the pertinent contradictions
Concrete analysis of concrete conditions, Lenin said, is "the most essential thing in Marxism, the living soul of Marxism"
Lacking an analytical approach, many of our comrades do not want to go deeply into complex matters, 
Lacking an analytical approach, many of our comrades do not want to analyse and study them over and over again, 
Lacking an analytical approach, many of our comrades like to draw simple conclusions which are either affirmative or absolutely negative
Between the opposites in a contradiction there is at once unity and struggle, and it is this that impels things to move and change
Contradictions exist everywhere, but they differ in accordance with the different nature of different things
Unless one makes the effort, one is liable to slip into idealism and metaphysics
When we look at a thing, we must examine its essence and treat its appearance merely as an usher at the threshold
We must grasp the essence of the thing; this is the only reliable and scientific method of analysis
Idealism and metaphysics are the easiest things in the world, because people can talk as much nonsense as they like 
Marxism teaches that in our approach to a problem we should start from objective facts, not from abstract definitions
We marxists should derive our guiding principles, policies and measures from an analysis of the facts
The most fundamental method of work is to determine our working policies according to actual conditions
All genuine knowledge originates in direct experience
Knowledge begins with practice, and theoretical knowledge is acquired through practice and must then return to practice
If you want knowledge, you must take part in the practice of changing reality
If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear by eating it yourself
If you want to know the theory and methods of revolution, you must take part in revolution
Generally speaking, those that succeed are correct and those that fail are incorrect
Man's knowledge makes another leap through the test of practice;This leap is more important than the previous one
The leap to conceptual knowledge, ie, to ideas, occurs when sufficient perceptual knowledge is accumulated
God sent down two angels, who carried the mountains away on their backs; One is imperialism, the other is feudalism
We must persevere and work unceasingly, and we, too, will touch God's heart
High as they are, the mountains cannot grow any higher and with every bit we dig, they will be that much lower
A good comrade is one who is more eager to go where the difficulties are greater
What is work? Work is struggle
New things always have to experience difficulties and setbacks as they grow
It is sheer fantasy to imagine that the cause of socialism is all plain sailing and easy success
It is sheer fantasy to imagine that the cause of socialism is without difficulties and setbacks or the exertion of tremendous efforts
Our difficulties can be overcome because we are new and rising forces and have a bright future
The reactionary forces and we both have difficulties
The difficulties of the reactionary forces are insurmountable because they are forces on the verge of death and have no future
The wealth of society is created by the workers, peasants and working intellectuals
In a word, while the prospects are bright, the road has twists and turns;There are still many difficulties ahead which we must not overlook
In a word, while the prospects are bright, the road has twists and turns
There are still many difficulties ahead which we must not overlook
By uniting with the entire people in a common effort, we can certainly overcome all difficulties and win victory
It must not be imagined that one fine morning all the reactionaries will go down on their knees of their own accord
There are no straight roads in the world
We must be prepared to follow a road which twists and turns and not try to get things on the cheap
We must recognize difficulties, analyse them and combat them
We must thoroughly clear away all ideas amoung our cadres of winning easy victories through good luck
We must thoroughly clear away all ideas amoung our cadres of winning easy victories without hard and bitter struggle
We must thoroughly clear away all ideas amoung our cadres of winning easy victories without sweat and blood
The comrades must be taught to preserve the style of plain living and hard struggle
On what basis should our policy rest? It should rest on our own strength, and that means regeneration through one's own efforts
We are not alone; all the countries and people in the world opposed to imperialism are our friends
We stand for self-reliance
Every word, every act and every policy must conform to the people's interests, and if mistakes occur, they must be corrected
We hope for foreign aid but cannot be dependent on it; 
We depend on our own efforts, on the creative power of the whole army and the entire people
To win countrywide victory is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li
The comrades must be taught to remain modest, prudent and free from arrogance and rashness in their style of work
The comrades must be taught to preserve the style of plain living and hard struggle
Proletarian literature and art are part of the whole proletarian revolutionary cause; 
Proletarian literature and art are, as Lenin said, cogs and wheels in the whole revolutionary machine
Revolutionary culture is a powerful revolutionary weapon for the broad masses of the people
Revolutionary culture prepares the ground ideologically before the revolution comes 
Revolutionary culture is an important, indeed essential, fighting front in the general revolutionary front during the revolution
All our literature and art are for the masses of the people, and in the first place for the workers, peasants and soldiers; 
All our literature and art are created for the workers, peasants and soldiers and are for their use
Our literary and art workers must gradually move their feet over to the side of to the side of the proletariat, 
Our literary and art workers must gradually move their feet over through the process of studying Marxism and society
We have a literature and art that are truly for the workers, peasants and soldiers, a truly proletarian literature and art
Our purpose is to ensure that literature and art fit well into the whole revolutionary machine as a component part,
Ensure that literature and art that operate as powerful weapons for uniting and educating the people 
Ensure that literature and art that operate as powerful weapons for attacking and destroying the enemy, 
Ensure that literature and art help the people fight the enemy with one heart and one mind
In literary and art criticism there are two criteria, the political and the artistic 
There is the political criterion and there is the artistic criterion; what is the relationship between the two? 
Politics cannot be equated with art, nor can a general world outlook be equated with a method of artistic creation and criticism
We deny that there is an abstract and absolutely unchangeable political criterion
Each class in every class society has its own political and artistic criteria
What we demand is the unity of politics and art, the unity of content and form
What we demand is the unity of revolutionary political content and the highest possible perfection of artistic form
We oppose both tendency to produce works of art with a wrong political viewpoint 
We oppose the tendency towards the "poster and slogan style" which is correct in political viewpoint but lacking in artistic power
A commander's correct dispositions stem from his correct decisions, his correct decisions stem from his correct judgements
Correct judgements stem from from pondering on and piecing together the data of various kinds 
Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin have taught us that it is necessary to study conditions conscientiously 
Proceed from objective reality and not from subjective wishes; but many of our comrades act in direct violation of this truth
You can't solve a problem? Well, get down and investigate the present facts and its past history! 
When you have investigated the problem thoroughly, you will know how to solve it
Conclusions invariably come after investigation, and not before
Only a block-head cudgels his brains on his own to "find a soltuion" or "evolve an idea" without making any investigation
Oppose Book Worship
Investigation may be likened to the long months of pregnancy, and solving a problem to the day of birth
To investigate a problem is, indeed to solve it
A person applies the theory and method of Marxism-Leninism to the systematic and thorough investigation and study of the environment
He does not work by enthusiasm alone but, as Stalin says, combines revolutionary sweep with practicalness
The only way to know conditions is to make social investigations, to investigate the conditions of each social class in real life
A fact-finding meeting need not be large; from three to five or seven or eight people are enough
Successors to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat come forward in mass struggles and are tempered in the great storms of revolution
It is essential to test and know cadres and choose and train successors in the long course of mass struggle
Cadres are a decisive factor, once the political line is determined
Therefore, it is our fighting task to train large numbers of new cadres in a planned way
It is necessary to maintain the system of cadre participation in collective productive labour
By taking part in collective productive labour, the cadres maintain extensive, constant and close ties with the working people
This is a major measure of fundamental importance for a socialist system; it helps to prevent revisionism and dogmatism
We must know how to judge cadres
We must not confine our judgement to a short period or a single incident in a cadre's life, but should consider his life as a whole
We must know how to use cadres well
In the final analysis, leadership involves two main responsibilities: to work out ideas, and to use cadres well
