hello world
 The seizure of power by armed force, the settlement of the issue by war, is the central task and the highest form of revolution
128
  According to the Marxist theory of the state, the army is the chief component of state power
94
 Whoever wants to seize and retain state power must have a strong army
70
 Some people ridicule us as advocates of the "omnipotence of war"
65
 Yes, we are advocates of the omnipotence of revolutionary war; that is good, not bad, it is Marxist
100
 We shall create a democratic republic
38
 Experience in the class struggle in the era of imperialism teaches us that it is only by the power of the gun that the working class and the labouring masses can defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords; in this sense we may say that only with guns can the whole world be transformed
286
  The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism
64
  If there is to be revolution, there must be a revolutionary party
67
 Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and in the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary style, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs

 A revolutionary party: a party built on the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and in the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary style, 
it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs
268
 Without this core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious
63
 These are two cardinal principles
34
 If we doubt these principles, we shall accomplish nothing
58
  On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation (July 31, 1955), 3rd ed
70
 No political party can possibly lead a great revolutionary movement to victory unless it possesses revolutionary theory and a knowledge of history and has a profound grasp of the practical movement
198
  As we used to say, the rectification movement is "a widespread movement of Marxist education"
95
 We can certainly learn more Marxism in the course of the rectification movement
80
 Policy is the starting-point of all the practical actions of a revolutionary party and manifests itself in the process and the end-result of that party's actions
162
 A revolutionary party is carrying out a policy whenever it takes any action
76
 If it is not carrying out a correct policy, it is carrying out a wrong policy; if it is not carrying out a given policy consciously, it is doing so blindly
156
 What we call experience is the process and the end-result of carrying out a policy
83
 Only through the practice of the people, that is, through experience, can we verify whether a policy is correct or wrong and determine to what extent it is correct or wrong
173
 But people's practice, especially the practice of a revolutionary party and the revolutionary masses, cannot but be related to one policy or another
149
 CLASSES AND CLASS STRUGGLE   Classes struggle, some classes triumph, others are eliminated
91
 Such is history, such is the history of civilization for thousands of years
76
 To interpret history from this viewpoint is historical materialism; standing in opposition to this viewpoint is historical idealism
132
  In class society everyone lives as a member of a particular class, and every kind of thinking, without exception, is stamped with the brand of a class
152
  Changes in society are due chiefly to the development of the internal contradictions in society, that is, the contradiction between the productive forces and the relations of production, the contradiction between classes and the contradiction between the old and the new; it is the development of these contradictions that pushes society forward and gives the impetus for the supersession of the old society by the new
420
  The ruthless economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasants by the landlord class forced them into numerous uprisings against its rule 
153
 In the final analysis, national struggle is a matter of class struggle
71
 Among the whites in the United States it is only the reactionary ruling circles who oppress the black people
109
 They can in no way represent the workers, farmers, revolutionary intellectuals and other enlightened persons who comprise the overwhelming majority of the white people
168
 3-4 It is up to us to organize the people
42
 Everything reactionary is the same; if you don't hit it, it won't fall
71
 It is like sweeping the floor; where the broom does not reach, the dust never vanishes of itself
97
  The enemy will not perish of himself
38
  A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous
210
 A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another
90
 And we? Our policy is to give him tit for tat and to fight for every inch of land
82
 We act after his fashion
25
 He always tries to impose war on the people, one sword in his left hand and another in his right
97
 We take up swords, too, following his example
46
  Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of the first importance for the revolution
105
 A revolutionary party is the guide of the masses, and no revolution ever succeeds when the revolutionary party leads them astray
129
 To ensure that we will definitely achieve success in our revolution and will not lead the masses astray, we must pay attention to uniting with our real friends in order to attack our real enemies
196
  Our enemies are all those in league with imperialism--the warlords, the bureaucrats, the comprador class, the big landlord class and the reactionary section of the intelligentsia attached to them
197
 The leading force in our revolution is the industrial proletariat
66
 Our closest friends are the entire semi-proletariat and petty bourgeoisie
74
 As for the vacillating middle bourgeoisie, their right-wing may become our enemy and their left-wing may become our friend--but we must be constantly on our guard and not let them create confusion within our ranks
214
 Whoever sides with the revolutionary people is a revolutionary
63
 Whoever sides with imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism is a counter-revolutionary
95
 Whoever sides with the revolutionary people in words only but acts otherwise is a revolutionary in speech
106
 Whoever sides with the revolutionary people in deed as well as in word is a revolutionary in the full sense
108
  I hold that it is bad as far as we are concerned if a person, a political party, an army or a school is not attacked by the enemy, for in that case it would definitely mean that we have sunk to the level of the enemy
218
 It is good if we are attacked by the enemy, since it proves that we have drawn a clear line of demarcation between the enemy and ourselves
139
 It is still better if the enemy attacks us wildly and paints us as utterly black and without a single virtue; it demonstrates that we have not only drawn a clear line of demarcation between the enemy and ourselves but achieved a great deal in our work
252
  To Be Attacked by the Enemy Is Not a Bad Thing but a Good Thing (May 26, 1939), 1st pocket ed
95
 We should support whatever the enemy opposes and oppose whatever the enemy supports
84
  Our stand is that of the proletariat and of the masses
56
  After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, there will still be enemies without guns; they are bound to struggle desperately against us; we must never regard these enemies lightly
186
 If we do not now raise and understand the problem in this way, we shall commit very grave mistakes
99
 The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will certainly not take their defeat lying down and they will struggle to the last ditch
133
 After there is peace and order throughout the country, they will still engage in sabotage and create disturbances in various ways and will try every day and every minute to stage a come-back
191
 This is inevitable and beyond all doubt, and under no circumstances must we relax our vigilance
96
 The class struggle is by no means over
39
 The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between the different political forces, and the class struggle in the ideological field between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie will continue to be long and tortuous and at times even become very acute
289
 The proletariat seeks to transform the world according to its own world outlook, and so does the bourgeoisie
109
 In this respect, the question of which will win out, socialism or capitalism, is not really settled
100
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
  It will take a fairly long period of time to decide the issue in the ideological struggle between socialism and capitalism in our country
139
 The reason is that the influence of the bourgeoisie and of the intellectuals who come from the old society will remain in our country for a long time to come, the so will their class ideology 
193
 If this is not sufficiently understood, or is not understood at all, the gravest mistakes will be made and the necessity of waging struggle in the ideological field will be ignored
181
  In our country bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology, anti-Marxist ideology, will continue to exist for a long time
118
 Basically, the socialist system has been established in our country
68
 We have won the basic victory in transforming the ownership of the means of production, but we have not yet won complete victory on the political and ideological fronts
169
 In the ideological field, the question of who will win in the struggle between the proletariat or the bourgeoisie has not been really settled yet
146
 We still have to wage a protracted struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology
91
 It is wrong not to understand this and to give up ideological struggle
71
 All erroneous ideas, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters, must be subjected to criticism; in no circumstances should they be allowed to spread unchecked
162
 However, the criticism should be fully reasoned, analytical and convincing, and not rough, bureaucratic, metaphysical or dogmatic
130
 Both dogmatism and revisionism run counter to Marxism
54
 Marxism must certainly advance; it must develop along with practice and cannot stand still
91
 It would become lifeless if it remained stagnant and stereotyped
65
 However, the basic principles of Marxism must never be violated, otherwise mistakes will be made
97
 It is dogmatism to approach Marxism from a metaphysical point of view and to regard it as something rigid
106
 It is revisionism to negate the basic principles of Marxism and to negate its universal truth
94
 Revisionism is one form of bourgeois ideology
46
 The revisionists deny the differences between socialism and capitalism, between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie
156
 What they advocate is in fact not the socialist line but the capitalist line
77
 One of our current important tasks on the ideological front is to unfold criticism of revisionism
98
  Revisionism, or Right opportunism, is a bourgeois trend of thought that is even more dangerous than dogmatism
111
 The revisionists, the Right opportunists, pay lip-service to Marxism; they too attack "dogmatism"
98
 But what they are really attacking is the quintessence of Marxism
66
 After the basic victory of the socialist revolution in our country, there are still a number of people who vainly hope to restore the capitalist system and fight the working class on every front, including the ideological one
226
 And their right-hand men in this struggle are the revisionists
63
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
 SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM   Communism is at once a complete system of proletarian ideology and a new social system
113
 It is different from any other ideology or social system, and is the most complete, progressive, revolutionary and rational system in human history
148
 The ideological and social system of feudalism has a place only in the museum of history
89
 The ideological and social system of capitalism has also become a museum piece in one part of the world (in the Soviet Union), while in other countries it resembles "a dying person who is sinking fast, like the sun setting beyond the western hills", and will soon be relegated to the museum
291
 The communist ideological and social system alone is full of youth and vitality, sweeping the world with the momentum of an avalanche and the force of a thunderbolt
165
 360-361

 The socialist system will eventually replace the capitalist system; this is an objective law independent of man's will
119
 However much the reactionaries try to hold back the wheel of history, sooner or later revolution will take place and will inevitably triumph
141
 in Celebration of the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution" (November 6, 1957)
101
  We Communists never conceal our political views
49
 The democratic revolution is the necessary preparation for the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution is the inevitable sequel to the democratic revolution
168
 The ultimate aim for which all communists strive is to bring about a socialist and communist society
101
 Socialist revolution aims at liberating the productive forces
62
 The change-over from individual to socialist, collective ownership in agricultural and handicrafts and from capitalist to socialist ownership in private industry and commerce is bound to bring about a tremendous liberation of the productive forces
248
 Thus the social conditions are being created for a tremendous expansion of industrial and agricultural production
114
  We are now carrying out a revolution not only in the social system, the change from private to public ownership, but also in technology, the change from handicraft to large-scale modern machine production, and the two revolutions are interconnected
250
 In agriculture, with conditions as they are in our country, co-operation must precede the use of big machinery (in capitalist countries agriculture develops in a capitalist way)
178
 Therefore we must on no account regard industry and agriculture, socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture as two separate and isolated things, and on no account must we emphasize the one and play down the other
246
  On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation (July 31, 1955), 3rd ed
70
  The new social system has only just been established and requires time for its consolidation
94
 It must not be assumed that the new system can be completely consolidated the moment it is established, for that is impossible
127
 It has to be consolidated step by step
39
 To achieve its ultimate consolidation, it is necessary not only to bring about the socialist industrialization of the country and persevere in the socialist revolution on the economic front, but also to carry on constant and arduous socialist revolutionary struggles and socialist education on the political and ideological fronts
331
 Moreover, various complementary international conditions are required
70
 But we should all realize that the new system of socialism will unquestionably be consolidated
95
 We can assuredly build a socialist state with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture
114
  The number of intellectuals who are hostile to our state is very small
72
 They do not like our state, ie the dictatorship of the proletariat, and yearn for the old society
98
 As between the proletarian and the bourgeois roads, as between the socialist and the capitalist roads, they stubbornly choose to follow the latter
147
 In fact this road is impossible, and in fact, therefore, they are ready to capitulate to imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism
138
 Such persons are found in political circles and in industrial and commercial, cultural and educational, scientific and technological and religious circles, and they are extremely reactionary
191
  The serious problem is the education of the peasantry
55
 The peasant economy is scattered, and the socialization of agriculture, judging by the Soviet Union's experience, will require a long time and painstaking work
160
 Without socialization of agriculture, there can be no complete, consolidated socialism
87
 These two points are the essence of the matter, the main current
65
  On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation (July 31, 1955), 3rd ed
70
 The leading bodies in co-operatives must establish the dominant position of the poor peasants and the new lower middle peasants in these bodies, with the old lower middle peasants and the upper middle peasants--whether old or new--as the supplementary force
258
 Otherwise, unity between the middle and poor peasants cannot be attained, the co-operatives cannot be consolidated, production cannot be expanded and the socialist transformation of the entire countryside cannot be achieved
224
  It is essential to unite with the middle peasants, and it is wrong not to do so
81
 That was the case when the struggle against the landlords was being waged and the land reform was being carried out, and that is the case today when the struggle against the rich peasants and other capitalist elements is being waged to achieve the socialist transformation of agriculture
288
 In both these revolutionary periods, the middle peasants wavered in the initial stages
87
 It is only after they clearly see the general trend of events and the approaching triumph of the revolution that the middle peasants will come in on the side of the revolution
176
 The poor peasants must work on the middle peasants and win them over, so that the revolution will broaden from clay to day until final victory
143
  There is a serious tendency towards capitalism among the well-to-do peasants
78
 This tendency will become rampant if we in the slightest way neglect political work among the peasants during the co-operative movement and for a very long period after
169
  The agricultural co-operative movement has been a severe ideological and political struggle from the very beginning
117
 No cooperative can be established without going through such a struggle
72
 Before a brand-new social system can be built on the site of the old the site must be swept clean
98
 Invariably, remnants of old ideas reflecting the old system remain in people's minds for a long time, and they do not easily give way
134
 After a co-operative is established, it must go through many more struggles before it can be consolidated
106
 Even then, the moment it relaxes its efforts it may collapse
61
  The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants
217
 On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land
173
 If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day
110
 Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties
174
 Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road
201
 Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand firm in these circumstances? Obviously not
93
 There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis
59
 And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together
471
 We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance

95
 More people mean a greater ferment of ideas, more enthusiasm and more energy
77
 Never before have the masses of the people been so inspired, so militant and so daring as at present
101
 This may seem a bad thing, but in reality it is a good thing
61
 Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, the desire for action and the desire for revolution
97
 On a blank sheet of paper free from any mark, the freshest and most beautiful characters can be written, the freshest and most beautiful pictures can be painted
161
 The first is internal that is, the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie
95
  Consequently, after the victory of the people's democratic revolution, the state power of the people's republic under the leadership of the working class must not be weakened but must be strengthened
201
  "Don't you want to abolish state power?" Yes, we do, but not right now; we cannot do it yet
93
 Why? Because imperialism still exists, because domestic reaction still exists, because classes still exist in our country
122
 Our present task is to strengthen the people's state apparatus--mainly the people's army, the people's police and the people's courts--in order to consolidate national defence and protect the people's interests
211
  Our state is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance
115
 What is this dictatorship for? Its first function is to suppress the reactionary classes and elements and those exploiters in our country who resist the socialist revolution, to suppress those who try to wreck our socialist construction, or in other words, to resolve the internal contradictions between ourselves and the enemy
328
 For instance, to arrest, try and sentence certain counter-revolutionaries, and to deprive landlords and bureaucrat-capitalists of their right to vote and their freedom of speech for a specified period of time--all this comes within the scope of our dictatorship
262
 To maintain public order and safeguard the interests of the people, it is likewise necessary to exercise dictatorship over embezzlers, swindlers, arsonists, murderers, criminal gangs and other scoundrels who seriously disrupt public order
239
 The second function of this dictatorship is to protect our country from subversion and possible aggression by external enemies
127
 In that event, it is the task of this dictatorship to resolve the external contradiction between ourselves and the enemy
121
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
  The people's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class
80
 For it is only the working class that is most far-sighted, most selfless and most thoroughly revolutionary
107
 The entire history of revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class revolution fails and that with the leadership of the working class revolution triumphs
176
 These two classes are the main force in overthrowing imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries
98
 The transition from New Democracy to socialism also depends mainly upon their alliance
87
  Class struggle, the struggle for production and scientific experiment are the three great revolutionary movements for building a mighty socialist country
155
 These movements are a sure guarantee that Communists will be free from bureaucracy and immune against revisionism and dogmatism, and will for ever remain invincible
165
 They are a reliable guarantee that the proletariat will be able to unite with the broad working masses and realize a democratic dictatorship
141
  Note on "The Seven Well-Written Documents of Chekiang Province Concerning Cadres' Participation in Physical Labour" (May 9, 1963), quoted in On Khrushchov's Phoney Communism and Its Historical Lessons f or the World
217
 The people's democratic dictatorship uses two methods
54
 Towards the enemy, it uses the method of dictatorship, that is, for as long a period of time as is necessary it does not let them take part in political activities and compels them to obey the law of the People's Government and to engage in labour and, through labour, transform themselves into new men
303
 Towards the people, on the contrary, it uses the method not of compulsion but of democracy, that is, it must necessarily let them take part in political activities and does not compel them to do this or that, but uses the method of democracy in educating and persuading them
275
 This is a socialist movement for the self-education and self-remoulding of the people

70
 ON THE CORRECT HANDLING OF CONTRADICTIONS AMONG THE PEOPLE   We are confronted with two types of social contradictions -- those between ourselves and the enemy and those among the people themselves
198
 The two are totally different in their nature
46
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
  To understand these two different types of contradictions correctly, we must first be clear on what is meant by "the people" and what is meant by "the enemy"
159
  At the present stage, the period of building socialism, the classes, strata and social groups which favour, support and work for the cause of socialist construction all come within the category of the people, while the social forces and groups which resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to or sabotage socialist construction are all enemies of the people
367
 Our People's Government is one that genuinely represents the people's interests, it is a government that serves the people
123
 Nevertheless, there are still certain contradictions between this government and the people
92
 These include the contradictions between the interests of the state and the interests of the collective and the interests of the individual; between democracy and centralism; between the leadership and the led; and the contradictions arising from the bureaucratic style of work of certain government workers in their relations with the masses
343
 All these are also contradictions among the people
51
 Generally speaking, the people's basic identity of interests underlies the contradictions among the people
107
  The contradictions between ourselves and the enemy are antagonistic contradictions
84
 Within the ranks of the people, the contradictions among the working people are non-antagonistic, while those between the exploited and the exploiting classes have a non-antagonistic in addition to an antagonistic aspect
221
  In the political life of our people, how should right be distinguised from wrong in one's words and actions? On the basis of the principles of our Constitution, the will of the overwhelming majority of our people and the common political positions which have been proclaimed on various occasions by our political parties and groups, we consider that, broadly speaking, the criteria should be as follows:   (1) Words and deeds should help to unite, and not divide, the people of all  our nationalities
502
    (2) They should be beneficial, and not harmful, to socialist transformation  and socialist construction
107
    (3) They should help to consolidate, and not undermine or weaken, the people's  democratic dictatorship
107
    (4) They should help to consolidate, and not undermine or weaken, democratic  centralism
92
    (6) They should be beneficial, and not harmful, to international socialist  unity and the unity of the peace-loving people of the world
139
  The question of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is one of a struggle between ourselves and the enemy, a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy
155
 Among the people, there are some who see this question in a somewhat different light
85
 Two kinds of people hold views differing from ours
51
 Those with a Rightist way of thinking make no distinction between ourselves and the enemy and take the enemy for our own people
128
 They regard as friends the very persons whom the masses regard as enemies
74
 Those with a "Left" deviation in their thinking magnify contradictions between ourselves and the enemy to such an extent that they take certain contradictions among the people for contradictions with the enemy and regard as counter-revolutionaries persons who are actually not counter-revolutionaries
301
 Both these views are wrong
27
 Neither can lead to the correctly handling of the problem of suppressing counter-revolutionaries or to a correct assessment of this work
137
 Qualitatively different contradictions can only be resolved by qualitatively different methods
95
  The principle of using different methods to resolve different contradictions is one which Marxist-Leninists must strictly observe
131
  Since they are different in nature, the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and the contradictions among the people must be resolved by different methods
166
 To put it briefly, the former entail drawing a clear distinction between ourselves and the enemy, and the latter entail drawing a clear distinction between right and wrong
172
 It is, of course, true that the distinction between ourselves and the enemy is also one of right and wrong
107
 For example, the question of who is in the right, we or the domestic and foreign reactionaries, the imperialists, the feudalists and bureaucrat-capitalists, is also a matter of right and wrong, but it is in a different category from questions of right and wrong among the people
279
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
  The only way to settle questions of an ideological nature or controversial issues among the people is by the democratic method, the method of discussion, criticism, persuasion and education, and not by the method of coercion or repression
240
  To be able to carry on their production and studies effectively and to arrange their lives properly, the people want their government and those in charge of production and of cultural and educational organizations to issue appropriate orders of an obligatory nature
267
 It is common sense that the maintenance of public order would be impossible without such adminstrative regulations
115
 Administrative orders and the method of persuasion and education complement each other in resolving contradictions among the people
132
 Even administrative regulations for the maintenance of public order must be accompanied by persuasion and education, for in many cases regulations alone will not work
167
  Inevitably, the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie will give expression to their own ideologies
96
 Inevitably, they will stubbornly express themselves on political and ideological questions by every possible means
115
 You cannot expect them to do otherwise
39
 We should not use the method of suppression and prevent them from expressing themselves, but should allow them to do so and at the same time argue with them and direct appropriate criticism at them
198
 We must undoubtedly criticize wrong ideas of every description
63
 It certainly would not be right to refrain from criticism, look on while wrong ideas spread unchecked and allow them to monopolize the field
141
 Mistakes must be criticized and poisonous weeds fought wherever they crop up
77
 However, such criticism should not be dogmatic, and the metaphysical method should not be used, but instead the effort should be made to apply the dialectical method
166
 What is needed is scientific analysis and convincing argument
62
  To criticize the people's shortcomings is necessary, but in doing so we must truly take the stand of the people and speak out of whole-hearted eagerness to protect and educate them
182
 To treat comrades like enemies is to go over to the stand of the enemy
71
  Contradiction and struggle are universal and absolute, but the methods of resolving contradictions, that is, the forms of struggle, differ according to the differences in the nature of the contradictions
205
 Some contradictions are characterized by open antagonism, others are not
73
 In accordance with the concrete development of things, some contradictions which were originally non-antagonistic develop into antagonistic ones, while others which were originally antagonistic develop into non-antagonistic ones
229
  In ordinary circumstances, contradictions among the people are not antagonistic
81
 But if they are not handled properly, or if we relax our vigilance and lower our guard, antagonism may arise
109
 In a socialist country, a development of this kind is usually only a localized and temporary phenomenon
104
 The reason is that the system of exploitation of man by man has been abolished and the interests of the people are basically the same
134
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
  In our country, the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie belongs to the category of contradictions among the people
149
 In the period of the bourgeois-democratic revolution, it had both a revolutionary and a conciliationist side to its character
126
 In the period of the socialist revolution, exploitation of the working class for profit constitutes one side of the character of the national bourgeoisie, while its support of the Constitution and its willingness to accept socialist transformation constitute the other
269
 The national bourgeoisie differs from the imperialists, the landlords and the bureaucrat-capitalists
101
 The contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class is one between exploiter and exploited, and is by nature antagonistic
143
 However, it will change into a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy if we do not handle it properly and do not follow the policy of uniting with, criticizing and educating the national bourgeoisie, or if the national bourgeoisie does not accept this policy of ours
274
  It [the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary in 1956] was a case of reactionaries inside a socialist country, in league with the imperialists, attempting to achieve their conspiratorial aims by taking advantage of contradictions among the people to foment dissension and stir up disorder
295
 The lesson of the Hungarian incident merits attention
54
 WAR AND PEACE   War is the highest form of struggle for resolving contradictions, when they have developed to a certain stage, between classes, nations, states, or political groups, and it has existed ever since the emergence of private property and of classes
261
 Unless you understand the actual circumstances of war, its nature and its relations to other things, you will not know the laws of war, or know how to direct war, or be able to win victory
189
  "War is the continuation of politics
38
" In this sense war is politics and war itself is a political action; since ancient times there has never been a war that did not have a political character 
157
  But war has its own particular characteristics and in this sense it cannot be equated with politics in general
112
 "War is the continuation of politics by other means
52
" When politics develops to a certain stage beyond which it cannot proceed by the usual means, war breaks out to sweep the obstacles from the way 
146
 When the obstacle is removed and our political aim attained, the war will stop
79
 But if the obstacle is not completely swept away, the war will have to continue till the aim is fully accomplished 
116
 It can therefore be said that politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed
101
 History shows that wars are divided into two kinds, just and unjust
68
 All wars that are progressive are just, and all wars that impede progress are unjust
85
 We Communists oppose all unjust wars that impede progress, but we do not oppose progressive, just wars
103
 Not only do we Communists not oppose just wars, we actively participate in them
80
 As for unjust wars, World War I is an instance in which both sides fought for imperialist interests; therefore the Communists of the whole world firmly opposed that war
169
 The way to oppose a war of this kind is to do everything possible to prevent it before it breaks out and, once it breaks out, to oppose war with war, to oppose unjust war with just war, whenever possible
204
  Revolutions and revolutionary wars are inevitable in class society and that without them, it is impossible to accomplish any leap in social development and to overthrow the reactionary ruling classes and therefore impossible for the people to win political power
264
 Revolutionary war is an antitoxin which not only eliminates the enemy's poison but also purges us of our own filth
115
 Every just, revolutionary war is endowed with tremendous power, which can transform many things or clear the way for their transformation
138
 Every Communist must grasp the truth, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun
88
  The seizure of power by armed force, the settlement of the issue by war, is the central task and the highest form of revolution
129
 According to the Marxist theory of the state, the army is the chief component of state power
93
 Whoever wants to seize and retain state power must have a strong army
70
 Some people ridicule us as advocates of the "omnipotence of war"
65
 Yes, we are advocates of the omnipotence of revolutionary war; that is good, not bad, it is Marxist
100
 We shall create a democratic republic
38
 Experience in the class struggle in the era of imperialism teaches us that it is only by the power of the gun that the working class and the labouring masses can defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords; in this sense we may say that only with guns can the whole world be transformed
286
  We are advocates of the abolition of war, we do not want war; but war can only be abolished through war, and in order to get rid of the gun it is necessary to take up the gun
176
  War, this monster of mutual slaughter among men, will be finally eliminated by the progress of human society, and in the not too distant future too
149
 But there is only one way to eliminate it and that is to oppose war with war, to oppose counter-revolutionary war with revolutionary war, to oppose national counter-revolutionary war with national revolutionary war, and to oppose counter-revolutionary class war with revolutionary class war 
292
 When human society advances to the point where classes and states are eliminated, there will be no more wars, counter-revolutionary or revolutionary, unjust or just; that will be the era of perpetual peace for mankind
218
 Our study of the laws of revolutionary war springs from the desire to eliminate all wars; herein lies the distinction between us Communists and all the exploiting classes
171
  Our country and all the other socialist countries want peace; so do the peoples of all the countries of the world
115
 The only ones who crave war and do not want peace are certain monopoly capitalist groups in a handful of imperialist countries which depend on aggression for their profits
172
  To achieve a lasting world peace, we must further develop our friendship and co-operation with the fraternal countries in the socialist camp and strengthen our solidarity with all peace-loving countries
204
 We must endeavour to establish normal diplomatic relations, on the basis of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty and of equality and mutual benefit, with all countries willing to live together with us in peace
230
 We must give active support to the national independence and liberation movement in countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America as well as to the peace movement and to just struggles in all the countries of the world
217
  As for the imperialist countries, we should unite with their people and strive to coexist peacefully with those countries, do business with them and prevent any possible war, but under no circumstances should we harbour any unrealistic notions about them
256
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
  We desire peace
17
 However, if imperialism insists on fighting a war, we will have no alternative but to take the firm resolution to fight to the finish before going ahead with our construction
175
 If you are afraid of war day in day out, what will you do if war eventually comes? First I said that the East Wind is prevailing over the West Wind and war will not break out, and now I have added these explanations about the situation in case war should break out
265
 Both possibilities have thus been taken into account
53
 People all over the world are now discussing whether or not a third world war will break out
93
 On this question, too, we must be mentally prepared and do some analysis
73
 We stand firmly for peace and against war
42
 But if the imperialists insist on unleashing another war, we should not be afraid of it
88
 Our attitude on this question is the same as our attitude towards any disturbance: first, we are against it; second, we are not afraid of it
141
 The First World War was followed by the birth of the Soviet Union with a population of 200 million
99
 The Second World War was followed by the emergence of the socialist camp with a combined population of 900 million
115
 If the imperialists insist on launching a third world war, it is certain that several hundred million more will turn to socialism, and then there will not be much room left on earth for the imperialists; it is also likely that the whole structure of imperialism will utterly collapse
284
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
  Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again till their doom; that is the logic of the imperialists and all reactionaries the world over in dealing with the people's cause, and they will never go against this logic
222
 This is a Marxist law
22
 When we say "imperialism is ferocious", we mean that its nature will never change, that the imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives, that they will never become Buddhas, till their doom
200
  Fight, fail, fight again, fail again, fight again till their victory; that is the logic of the people, and they too will never go against this logic
150
 This is another Marxist law
28
  Just because we have won victory, we must never relax our vigilance against the frenzied plots for revenge by the imperialists and their running dogs
151
 Whoever relaxes vigilance will disarm himself politically and land himself in a passive position
97
 That is certain; they will never neglect these activities
58
 They will do this as long as it is possible
44
 All this we must take fully into account
41
  The world is progressing, the future is bright and no one can change this general trend of history
100
 We should carry on constant propaganda among the people on the facts of world progress and the bright future ahead so that they will build their confidence in victory
167
 IMPERIALISM AND ALL REACTIONARIES ARE PAPER TIGERS   All reactionaries are paper tigers
88
 In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality they are not so powerful
89
 From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful
99
  Just as there is not a single thing in the world without a dual nature (this is the law of the unity of opposites), so imperialism and all reactionaries have a dual nature -- they are real tigers and paper tigers at the same time
231
 In past history, before they won state power and for some time afterwards, the slave-owning class, the feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie were vigorous, revolutionary and progressive; they were real tigers
213
 But with the lapse of time, because their opposites -- the slave class, the peasant class and the proletariat -- grew in strength step by step, struggled against them and became more and more formidable, these ruling classes changed step by step into the reverse, changed into reactionaries, changed into backward people, changed into paper tigers
348
 And eventually they were overthrown, or will be overthrown, by the people
74
 The reactionary, backward, decaying classes retained this dual nature even in their last life-and-death struggles against the people
133
 On the one hand, they were real tigers; they ate people, ate people by the millions and tens of millions
105
 The cause of the people's struggle went through a period of difficulties and hardships, and along the path there were many twists and turns
140
 Look! Were these not living tigers, iron tigers, real tigers? But in the end they changed into paper tigers, dead tigers, bean-curd tigers
139
 These are historical facts
27
 Have people not seen or heard about these facts? There have indeed been thousands and tens of thousands of them! Thousands and tens of thousands! Hence, imperialism and all reactionaries, looked at in essence, from a long-term point of view, from a strategic point of view, must be seen for what they are -- paper tigers
321
 On this we should build our strategic thinking
47
 On the other hand, they are also living tigers, iron tigers, real tigers which can eat people
94
 On this we should build our tactical thinking
46
 I have said that all allegedly powerful reactionaries are merely paper tigers
78
 The reason is that they are divorced from the people
53
 As we know, they were all overthrown
37
 US imperialism has not yet been overthrown and it has the atom bomb
68
 I believe it too will be overthrown
36
 It, too, is a paper tiger
26
 The reactionaries in all countries are fools of this kind
58
 In the final analysis, their persecution of the revolutionary people only serves to accelerate the people's revolutions on a broader and more intense scale
156
 in Celebration of the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution" (November 6, 1957)
101
 A short while ago it sent its armed forces to invade and occupy Lebanon
72
 The United States has set up hundreds of military bases in many countries all over the world
93
 The longer the US aggressors remain in those places, the tighter the nooses round their necks will become
106
  Imperialism will not last long because it always does evil things
67
 It persists in grooming and supporting reactionaries in all countries who are against the people, it has forcibly seized many colonies and semi-colonies and many military bases, and it threatens the peace with atomic war
221
 Thus, forced by imperialism to do so, more than 90 per cent of the people of the world are rising or will rise up in struggle against it
137
 Yet imperialism is still alive, still running amuck in Asia, Africa and Latin America
86
 In the West imperialism is still oppressing the people at home
63
 This situation must change
27
 It is the task of the people of the whole world to put an end to the aggression and oppression perpetrated by imperialism, and chiefly by US imperialism
153
  Interview with a Hsinhua News Agency correspondent (September 29, 1958)
73
  Riding roughshod everywhere, US imperialism has made itself the enemy of the people of the world and has increasingly isolated itself
135
 Those who refuse to be enslaved will never be cowed by the atom bombs and hydrogen bombs in the hands of the US imperialists
125
 The raging tide of the people of the world against tile US aggressors is irresistible
86
  If the US monopoly capitalist groups persist in pushing their policies of aggression and war, the day is bound to come when they will be hanged by the people of the whole world
178
 The same fate awaits the accomplices of the United States
58
  Over a long period we have developed this concept for the struggle against the enemy: strategically we should despise all our enemies, but tactically we should take them all seriously
185
 This also means that we must despise the enemy with respect to the whole, but that we must take him seriously with respect to each and every concrete question
159
 If we do not despise the enemy with respect to the whole, we shall be committing the error of opportunism
106
 Marx and Engels were only two individuals, and yet in those early days they already declared that capitalism would be overthrown throughout the world
150
 But in dealing with concrete problems and particular enemies we shall be committing the error of adventurism unless we take them seriously
139
 In war, battles can only be fought one by one and the enemy forces can only be destroyed one by one
100
 Factories can only be built one by one
39
 The peasants can only plough the land plot by plot
51
 The same is even true of eating a meal
39
 Strategically, we take the eating of a meal lightly&#151;we know we can finish it
82
 But actually we eat it mouthful by mouthful
44
 It is impossible to swallow an entire banquet in one gulp
58
 This is known as a piecemeal solution
38
 In military parlance, it is called wiping out the enemy forces one by one
74
  It is my opinion that the international situation has now reached a new turning point
87
 There are two winds in the world today, the East Wind and the West Wind
72
" I believe it is characteristic of the situation today that the East Wind is prevailing over the West Wind
107
 That is to say, the forces of socialism have become overwhelmingly superior to the forces of imperialism
105
 DARE TO STRUGGLE AND DARE TO WIN   People of the world, unite and defeat the US aggressors and all their running dogs! People of the world, be courageous, dare to fight, defy difficulties and advance wave upon wave
215
 Then the whole world will belong to the people

) Against US Aggression" (November 28, 1964), People of the World, Unite and Defeat the US Aggressors and All Their Lackeys, 2nd ed
131
 347  Historically, all reactionary forces on the verge of extinction invariably conduct a last desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces, and some revolutionaries are apt to be deluded for a time by this phenomenon of outward strength but inner weakness, failing to grasp the essential fact that the enemy is nearing extinction while they themselves are approaching victory
384
   If they [the Kuomintang] fight, we will wipe them out completely
67
 This is the way things are: if they attack and we wipe them out, they will have that satisfaction; wipe out some, some satisfaction; wipe out more, more satisfaction; wipe out the whole lot, complete satisfaction
213
 If they start fighting, we fight back, fight to win peace
58
  If anyone attacks us and if the conditions are favourable for battle we will certainly act in self-defence to wipe him out resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and completely (we do not strike rashly, but when we do strike, we must win)
232
 We must never be cowed by the bluster of reactionaries
55
 As far as our own desire is concerned, we don't want to fight even for a single day
84
 But if circumstances force us to fight, we can fight to the finish
67
  We are for peace
18
 Not that we are warlike
24
 We are willing to stop the war at once and leave the remaining questions for later settlement
94
 But US imperialism is not willing to do so
43
 All right then, let the fighting go on
39
  We should rid our ranks of all impotent thinking
50
 All views that overestimate the strength of the enemy and underestimate the strength of the people are wrong
109
  The oppressed peoples and nations must not pin their hopes for liberation on the "sensibleness" of imperialism and its lackeys
128
 They will only triumph by strengthening their unity and persevering in their struggle

  No matter when this country-wide civil war breaks out, we must be well prepared
81
 If it comes early, say, tomorrow morning, we should also be prepared
69
 That is point one
18
 In the present international and domestic situation it is possible that for a time the civil war may be kept restricted in scale and localized
143
 That is point two
18
 Point one is what we should prepare for point two is what has existed for a long time
86
 In short, we must be prepared
30
 Being prepared, we shall be able to deal properly with all kinds of complicated situations
91
 PEOPLE'S WAR   The revolutionary war is a war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them
127
 What is a true bastion of iron? It is the masses, the millions upon millions of people who genuinely and sincerely support the revolution
138
 That is the real iron bastion which no force can smash, no force whatsoever
76
 The counter-revolution cannot smash us; on the contrary, we shall smash it
75
 The richest source of power to wage war lies in the masses of the people
73
  The imperialists are bullying us in such a way that we will have to deal with them seriously
94
 Not only must we have a powerful regular army, we must also organize contingents of the people's militia on a big scale
120
 This will make it difficult for the imperialists to move a single inch in our country in the event of invasion
111
  Interview with a Hsinhua News Agency correspondent (September 29, 1958)
73
  Considering the revolutionary war as a whole, the operations of the people's guerrillas and those of the main forces of the Red Army complement each other like a man's right arm and left arm, and if we had only the main forces of the Red Army without the people's guerrillas, we would be like a warrior with only one arm
322
 In concrete terms, and especially with regard to military operations, when we talk of the people in the base area as a factor, we mean that we have an armed people
164
 That is the main reason why the enemy is afraid to approach our base area
74
  Unquestionably, victory or defeat in war is determined mainly by the military, political, economic and natural conditions on both sides
137
 But not by these alone
23
 It is also determined by each side's subjective ability in directing the war
77
 In his endeavour to win a war, a military man cannot overstep the limitations imposed by the material conditions; within these limitations, however, he can and must strive for victory
184
 The stage of action for a military man is built upon objective material conditions, but on that stage he i can direct the performance of many a drama, full of sound and colour, power and grandeur
196
 The object of war is specifically "to preserve oneself and destroy the enemy" (to destroy the enemy means to disarm him or "deprive him of the power to resist", and does not mean to destroy every member of his forces physically)
229
 In ancient warfare, the spear and the shield were used, the spear to attack and destroy the enemy, and the shield to defend and preserve oneself
145
 To the present day, all weapons are still an extension of the spear and the shield
83
 The bomber, the machine-gun, the long-range gun and poison gas are developments of the spear, while the air-raid shelter, the steel helmet, the concrete fortification and the gas mask are developments of the shield
215
 The tank is a new weapon combining the functions of both spear and shield
74
 Attack is the chief means of destroying the enemy, but defence cannot be dispensed with
88
 In attack the immediate object is to destroy the enemy, but at the same time it is self-preservation, because if the enemy is not destroyed, you will be destroyed
163
 In defence the immediate object is to preserve yourself, but at the same time defence is a means of supplementing attack or preparing to go over to the attack
159
 Retreat is in the category of defence and is a continuation of defence, while pursuit is a continuation of attack
114
 It should be pointed out that destruction of the enemy is the primary object of war and self-preservation the secondary, because only by destroying the enemy in large numbers can one effectively preserve oneself
212
 Therefore attack, the chief means of destroying the enemy, is primary, while defence, a supplementary means of destroying the enemy and a means of self-preservation, is secondary
179
 In actual warfare the chief role is played by defence much of the time and by attack for the rest of the time, but if war is taken as a whole, attack remains primary
166
  All the guiding principles of military operations grow out of the one basic principle: to strive to the utmost to preserve one's own strength and destroy that of the enemy
173
 In a revolutionary war, this principle is directly linked with basic political principles
90
 To attain this end, the operations of the armed units take the form of doing their utmost to preserve their own strength on the one hand and destroy the enemies on the other
174
 How then do we justify the encouragement of heroic sacrifice in war? Every war exacts a price, sometimes an extremely high one
127
 Is this not in contradiction with "preserving oneself"? In fact, these is no contradiction at all; to put it more exactly; sacrifice and self-preservation are both opposite and complementary to each other
205
 For such sacrifice is essential not only for destroying the enemy but also for preserving oneself--partial and temporary "non-preservation" (sacrifice, or paying the price) is necessary for the sake of general and permanent preservation
237
 From this basic principle stems the series of principles guiding military operations, all of which--from the principles of shooting (taking cover to preserve oneself, and making full use of fire-power to destroy the enemy) to the principles of strategy--are permeated with the spirit of this basic principle
308
 All technical, tactical and strategic principles represent applications of this basic principle
96
 The principle of preserving oneself and destroying the enemy is the basis of all military principles
101
 Our principles of operation are:   (1) Attack dispersed, isolated enemy forces first; attack concentrated, strong  enemy forces later
134
    (2) Take small and medium cities and extensive rural areas first; take big  cities later
92
    (3) Make wiping out the enemy's effective strength our main objective; do  not make holding or seizing a city or place our main objective
141
 Holding or  seizing a city or place is the outcome of wiping out the enemy's effective  strength, and often a city or place can be held or seized for good only after  it has changed hands a number of times
206
    (4) In every battle, concentrate an absolutely superior force (two, three,  four and sometimes even five or six times the enemy's strength), encircle  the enemy forces completely, strive to wipe them out thoroughly and do not  let any escape from the net
258
 In special circumstances, use the method of  dealing crushing blows to the enemy, that is, concentrate all our strength  to make a frontal attack and also to attack one or both of his flanks, with  the aim of wiping out one part and routing another so that our army can swiftly  move its troops to smash other enemy forces
323
 Strive to avoid battles of attrition  in which we lose more than we gain or only break even
92
 In this way, although  we are inferior as a whole (in terms of numbers), we are absolutely superior  in every part and every specific campaign, and this ensures victory in the  campaign
186
 As time goes on, we shall become superior as a whole and eventually  wipe out all the enemy
92
    (5) Fight no battle unprepared, fight no battle you are not sure of winning;  make every effort to be well prepared for each battle, make every effort  to ensure victory in the given set of conditions as between the enemy and  ourselves
240
    (6) Give full play to our style of fighting -- courage in battle, no fear  of sacrifice, no fear of fatigue, and continuous fighting (that is, fighting  successive battles in a short time without rest)
205
    (7) Strive to wipe out the enemy through mobile warfare
59
 At the same time,  pay attention to the tactics of positional attack and capture enemy fortified  points and cities
116
    (8) With regard to attacking cities, resolutely seize all enemy fortified  points and cities which are weakly defended
122
 Seize at opportune moments all  enemy fortified points and cities defended with moderate strength, provided  circumstances permit
130
 As for strongly defended enemy fortified points and  cities, wait till conditions are ripe and then take them
110
    (9) Replenish our strength with all the arms and most of the personnel captured  from the enemy
99
 Our army's main sources of manpower and mat&eacute;riel are  at the front
74
    (10) Make good use of the intervals between campaigns to rest, train and  consolidate our troops
100
 Periods of rest, training and consolidation should  in general not be very long, and the enemy should so far as possible be permitted  no breathing space
154
 They are the result of the tempering of the People's Liberation Army in long years of fighting against domestic and foreign enemies and are completely suited to our present situation
183
  our strategy and tactics are based on a people's war; no army opposed to the people can use our strategy and tactics
118
 Without preparedness superiority is not real superiority and there can be no initiative either
95
 Having grasped this point, a force which is inferior but prepared can often defeat a superior enemy by surprise attack
119
 THE PEOPLE'S ARMY   Without a people's army the people have nothing
68
 III, pp
8
  This army is powerful because all its members have a discipline based on political consciousness; they have come together and they fight not for the private interests of a few individuals or a narrow clique, but for the interests of the broad masses and of the whole nation
275
 The Red Army fights not merely for the sake of fighting but in order to conduct propaganda among the masses, organize them, arm them, and help them to establish revolutionary political power
191
 Without these objectives, fighting loses its meaning and the Red Army loses the reason for its existence
105
 The People's Liberation Army is always a fighting force
56
 Even after country-wide victory, our army will remain a fighting force during the historical period in which classes have not been abolished in our country and the imperialist system still exists in the world
209
 On this point there should be no misunderstanding or wavering
62
  We have an army for fighting as well as an army for labour
60
 For fighting we have the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies; but even they do a dual job, warfare and production
113
  Our national defence will be consolidated and no imperialist will be allowed to invade our territory again
108
 Our people's armed forces must be maintained and developed with the brave and steeled People's Liberation Army as their foundation
131
 We will have not only a powerful army but also a powerful air force and a powerful navy
88
 It has recently been found that in some (of course not all) leading bodies it is the habitual practice for one individual to monopolize the conduct of affairs and decide important problems
189
 Differences of opinion among committee members cannot be resolved and are left unresolved for a long time
106
 This situation must be changed
31
 All important problems (of course, not the unimportant, trivial problems, or problems whose solutions have already been decided after discussion at meetings and need only be carried out) must be submitted to the committee for discussion, and the committee members present should express their views fully and reach definite decisions which should then be carried out by the members concerned
392
 Furthermore, we must take care that neither collective leadership nor personal responsibility is overemphasized to the neglect of the other
140
 In the army, the person in command has the right to make emergency decisions during battle and when circumstances require
122
 It is indeed not easy to lead this squad well
46
 Each bureau or sub-bureau of the Central Committee now leads a vast area and shoulders very heavy responsibilities
115
 To lead means not only to decide general and specific policies but also to devise correct methods of work
106
 Even with correct general and specific policies, troubles may still arise if methods of work are neglected
107
 To be a good "squad leader", the secretary should study hard and investigate thoroughly
88
 A secretary or deputy secretary will find it difficult to direct his "squad" well if he does not take care to do propaganda and organizational work among his own "squad members", is not good at handling his relations with committee members or does not study how to run meetings successfully
291
 If the "squad members" do not march in step, they can never expect to lead tens of millions of people in fighting and construction
131
 Of course, the relation between the secretary and the committee members is one in which the minority must obey the majority, so it is different from the relation between a squad leader and his men
197
 Here we speak only by way of analogy
37
 Place problems on the table
28
 This should be done not only by the "squad leader" but by the committee members too
84
 Do not talk behind people's backs
34
 Whenever problems arise, call a meeting, place the problems on the table for discussion, take some decisions and the problems will be solved
141
 If problems exist and are not placed on the table, they will remain unsolved for a long time and even drag on for years
120
 The "squad leader" and the committee members should show understanding in their relations with each other
106
 "Exchange information
22
 This is of great importance in achieving a common language
59
 Some fail to do so and, like the people described by Lao Tzu, "do not visit each other all their lives, though the crowing of their cocks and the barking of their dogs are within hearing of each other"
202
 The result is that they lack a common language
47
  Ask your subordinates about matters you don't understand or don't know, and do not lightly express your approval or disapproval 
130
 We should never pretend to know what we don't know, we should "not feel ashamed to ask and learn from people below" and we should listen carefully to the views of the cadres at the lower levels
194
 Be a pupil before you become a teacher; learn from the cadres at the lower levels before you issue orders 
107
 What the cadres at the lower levels say may or may not be correct; we must analyse it
86
 We must heed the correct views and act upon them 
50
 Listen also to the mistaken views from below; it is wrong not to listen to them at all
87
 Such views, however, are not to be acted upon but to be criticized
67
 Learn to "play the piano"
26
 In playing the piano all ten fingers are in motion; it won't do to move some fingers only and not others
105
 But if all ten fingers press down at once, there is no melody
62
 To produce good music, the ten fingers should move rhythmically and in co-ordination
85
 At present, we have to take care of many fields; we must look after the work in all the areas, armed units and departments, and not give all our attention to a few problems, to the exclusion of others
201
 Wherever there is a problem, we must put our finger on it, and this is a method we must master
95
 Some play the piano well and some badly, and there is a great difference in the melodies they produce
102
  "Grasp firmly
15
 One can get a grip on something only when it is grasped firmly, without the slightest slackening
97
 Not to grasp firmly is not to grasp at all
43
 Naturally, one cannot get a grip on something with an open hand
64
 When the hand is clenched as if grasping something but is not clenched tightly, there is still no grip
103
 Some of our comrades do grasp the main tasks, but their grasp is not firm and so they cannot make a success of their work
122
 It will not do to have no grasp at all, nor will it do if the grasp is not firm
80
  "Have a head for figures
26
" That is to say, we must attend to the quantitative aspect of a situation or problem and make a basic quantitative analysis
124
 Every quality manifests itself in a certain quantity, and without quantity there can be no quality
99
 To this day many of our comrades still do not understand that they must attend to the quantitative aspect of things -- the basic statistics, the main percentages and the quantitative limits that determine the qualities of things
229
 They have no "figures" in their heads and as a result cannot help making mistakes
82
  "Notice to Reassure the Public
32
" Notice of meetings should be given beforehand; this is like issuing a "Notice to Reassure the Public", so that everybody will know what is going to be discussed and what problems are to be solved and can make timely preparations
230
 In some places, meetings of cadres are called without first preparing reports and draft resolutions, and only when people have arrived for the meeting are makeshifts improvised; this is just like the saying, "Troops and horses have arrived, but food and fodder are not ready", and that is no good
297
 Don't call a meeting in a hurry if the preparations are not completed
70
  "Fewer and better troops and simpler administration
53
" Talks, speeches, articles and resolutions should all be concise and to the point
82
 Meetings also should not go on too long
40
  Pay attention to uniting and working with comrades who differ with you
72
 This should be borne in mind both in the localities and in the army
68
 We have come together from every corner of the country and should be good at uniting in our work not only with comrades who hold the same views as we but also with those who hold different views
195
  Guard against arrogance
25
 For anyone in a leading position, this is a matter of principle and an important condition for maintaining unity
113
 Even those who have made no serious mistakes and have achieved very great success in their work should not be arrogant
119
  Draw two lines of distinction
31
 First, between revolution and counter-revolution, between Yenan and Sian
73
[1] Some do not understand that they must draw this line of distinction
71
 For example, when they combat bureaucracy, they speak of Yenan as though "nothing is right" there and fail to make a comparison and distinguish between the bureaucracy in Yenan and the bureaucracy in Sian
205
 This is fundamentally wrong
28
 Secondly, within the revolutionary ranks, it is necessary to make a clear distinction between right and wrong, between achievements and shortcomings and to make clear which of the two is primary and which secondary
215
 For instance, do the achievements amount to 30 per cent or to 70 per cent of the whole? It will not do either to understate or to overstate
140
 We must have a fundamental evaluation of a person's work and establish whether his achievements amount to 30 per cent and his mistakes to 70 per cent, or vice versa
165
 If his achievements amount to 70 per cent of the whole, then his work should in the main be approved
101
 It would be entirely wrong to describe work in which the achievements are primary as work in which the mistakes are primary
124
 In our approach to problems we must not forget to draw these two lines of distinction, between revolution and counter-revolution and between achievements and shortcomings
171
 We shall be able to handle things well if we bear these two distinctions in mind; otherwise we shall confuse the nature of the problems
136
 To draw these distinctions well, careful study and analysis are of course necessary
84
 Our attitude towards every person and every matter should be one of analysis and study
87
 In the sphere of organization, ensure democracy under centralized guidance
75
    (2) The higher bodies must be familiar with the life of the masses and with  the situation in the lower bodies so as to have an objective basis for correct  guidance
169
 Once a decision is reached, it must be firmly carried out
58
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung cited the two cities as symbols of revolution and counter-revolution
90
 THE MASS LINE   The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history
102
 The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant, and without this understanding it is impossible to acquire even the most rudimentary knowledge
179
 The masses have boundless creative power
41
 They can organize themselves and concentrate on places and branches of work where they can give full play to their energy; they can concentrate on production in breadth and depth and create more and more undertakings for their own well-being
242
 II  The present upsurge of the peasant movement is a colossal event
68
 They will smash all the trammels that bind them and rush forward along the road to liberation
94
 They will sweep all the imperialists, warlords, corrupt officials, local tyrants and evil gentry into their graves
115
 Every revolutionary party and every revolutionary comrade will be put to the test, to be accepted or rejected as they decide
125
 There are three alternatives
29
 The high tide of social transformation in the countryside, the high tide of co-operation, has already reached some places and will soon sweep over the whole country
165
 It is a vast socialist revolutionary movement involving a rural population of more than 500 million, and it has extremely great and world-wide significance
156
 We should give this movement active, enthusiastic and systematic leadership, and not drag it back by one means or another
122
 Some errors are unavoidable in the process; this is understandable, and they will not be hard to correct
105
 Shortcomings or mistakes among cadres and peasants can be remedied or overcome provided we give them positive help
115
  On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation (July 31, 1955), 3rd ed
70
 The masses have a potentially inexhaustible enthusiasm for socialism
69
 Those who can only follow the old routine in a revolutionary period are utterly incapable of seeing this enthusiasm
116
 They are blind and all is dark ahead of them
45
 At times they go so far as to confound right and wrong and turn things upside down
83
 Haven't we come across enough persons of this type? Those who simply follow the old routine invariably underestimate the people's enthusiasm
141
 Let something new appear and they always disapprove and rush to oppose it
74
 Afterwards, they have to admit defeat and do a little self-criticism
69
 But the next time something new appears, they go through the same process all over again
89
 This is their pattern of behaviour in regard to anything and everything new
76
 Such people are always passive, always fail to move forward at the critical moment, and always have to be given a shove in the back before they move a step
156
 We have always maintained that the revolution must rely on the masses of the people, on everybody's taking a hand, and have opposed relying merely on a few persons issuing orders
179
 The mass line, however, is still not being thoroughly carried out in the work of some comrades; they still rely solely on a handful of people working coolly and quietly by themselves
183
 One reason is that, whatever they do, they are always reluctant to explain it to the people they lead and that they do not understand why or how to give play to the initiative and creative energy of those they lead
215
 Subjectively, they too want everyone to take a hand in the work, but they do not let other people know what is to be done or how to do it
138
 That being the case, how can everyone be expected to get moving and how can anything be done well? To solve this problem the basic thing is, of course, to carry out ideological education on the mass line, but at the same time we must teach these comrades many concrete methods of work
285
 Twenty-four years of experience tell us that the right task, policy and style of work invariably conform with the demands of the masses at a given time and place and invariably strengthen our ties with the masses, and the wrong task, policy and style of work invariably disagree with the demands of the masses at a given time and place and invariably alienate us from the masses
379
 The reason why such evils as dogmatism, empiricism, commandism, tailism, sectarianism, bureaucracy and an arrogant attitude in work are definitely harmful and intolerable, and why anyone suffering from these maladies must overcome them, is that they alienate us from the masses
278
  To link oneself with the masses, one must act in accordance with the needs and wishes of the masses
101
 All work done for the masses muststart from their needs and not from the desire of any individual, however well-intentioned
124
 It often happens that objectively the masses need a certain change, but subjectively they are not yet conscious of the need, not yet willing or determined to make the change
174
 In such cases, we should wait patiently
40
 We should not make the change until, through our work, most of the masses have become conscious of the need and are willing and determined to carry it out
155
 Otherwise we shall isolate ourselves from the masses
53
 Unless they are conscious and willing, any kind of work that requires their participation will turn out to be a mere formality and will fail 
142
 There are two principles here: one is the actual needs of the masses rather than what we fancy they need, and the other is the wishes of the masses, who must make up their own minds instead of our making up their minds for them
228
 III, pp
8
 It should teach every comrade to love the people and listen attentively to the voice of the masses; to identify himself with the masses wherever he goes and, instead of standing above them, to immerse himself among them; and, according to their present level, to awaken them or raise their political consciousness and help them gradually to organize themselves voluntarily and to set going all essential struggles permitted by the internal and external circumstances of the given time and place
495
 III, pp
8
  If we tried to go on the offensive when the masses are not yet awakened, that would be adventurism
100
 If we insisted on leading the masses to do anything against their will, we would certainly fail
96
 If we did not advance when the masses demand advance, that would be Right opportunism
86
  Commandism is wrong in any type of work, because in overstepping the level of political consciousness of the masses and violating the principle of voluntary mass action it reflects the disease of impetuosity
209
 Our comrades must not assume that everything they themselves understand is understood by the masses
100
 Whether the masses understand it and are ready to take action can be discovered only by going into their midst and making investigations
137
 If we do so, we can avoid commandism
37
 Tailism in any type of work is also wrong, because in falling below the level of political consciousness of the masses and violating the principle of leading the masses forward it reflects the disease of dilatoriness
217
 Our comrades must not assume that the masses have no understanding of what they themselves do not yet understand
113
 It often happens that the masses outstrip us and are eager to advance a step when our comrades are still tailing behind certain backward elements, for instead of acting as leaders of the masses such comrades reflect the views of these backward elements and, moreover, mistake them for those of the broad masses
311
 Take the ideas of the masses and concentrate them, then got to the masses, persevere in the ideas and carry them through, so as to form correct ideas of leadership--such is the basic method of leadership
204
 This means: take the ideas of the masses (scattered and unsystematic ideas) and concentrate them (through study turn them into concentrated and systematic ideas), then go to the masses and propagate and explain these ideas until the masses embrace them as their own, hold fast to them and translate them into action, and test the correctness of these ideas in such action
372
 Then once again concentrate ideas from the masses and once again go to the masses so that the ideas are persevered in and carried through
138
 And so on, over and over again in an endless spiral, with the ideas becoming more correct, more vital and richer each time
123
 Such is the Marxist theory of knowledge
40
  We should go to the masses and learn from them, synthesize their experience into better, articulated principles and methods, then do propaganda among the masses, and call upon them to put these principles and methods into practice so as to solve their problems and help them achieve liberation and happiness
309
 This is one of the basic reasons why some of our work cannot be done well
74
  In all mass movements we must make a basic investigation and analysis of the number of active supporters, opponents and neutrals and must not decide problems subjectively and without basis
190
  The masses in any given place are generally composed of three parts, the relatively active, the intermediate and the relatively backward
138
 The leaders must therefore be skilled in uniting the small number of active elements around the leadership and must rely on them to raise the level of the intermediate element and to win over the backward elements
214
 It is also the dividing line that determines whether or not we make mistakes in our work
89
  However active the leading group may be, its activity will amount to fruitless effort by a handful of people unless combined with the activity of the masses
158
 On the other hand, if the masses alone are active without a strong leading group to organize their activity properly, such activity cannot be sustained for long, or carried forward in the right direction, or raised to a high level
231
  Production by the masses, the interests of the masses, the experiences and feelings of the masses -- to these the leading cadres should pay constant attention
160
  We should pay close attention to the well-being of the masses, from the problems of land and labour to those of fuel, rice, cooking oil and salt
146
 All such problems concerning the well-being of the masses should be placed on our agenda
89
 We should discuss them, adopt and carry out decisions and check up on the results
82
 We should help the masses to realize that we represent their interests, that our lives are intimately bound up with theirs
123
 We should help them to proceed from these things to an understanding of the higher tasks which we have put forward, the tasks of the revolutionary war, so that they will support the revolution and spread it throughout the country, respond to our political appeals and fight to the end for victory in the revolution
315
 [1] The Red Army, which was founded in 1927, and the Eighth Route Army of today have inherited this system and developed it
124
  The People's Liberation Army has developed its vigorous revolutionary political work, which is an important factor in winning victory over the enemy, on the basis of a people's war and of the principles of unity between army and people, of unity between commanders and fighters and of disintegrating the enemy troops
318
  This army has built up a system of political work which is essential for the people's war and is aimed at promoting unity in its own ranks, unity with the friendly armies and unity with the people, and at disintegrating the enemy forces and ensuring victory in battle
269
 Political work is the life-blood of all economic work
54
 This is particularly true at a time when the social and economic system is undergoing fundamental change
105
  The political work of the Eighth Route Army is guided by three basic principles
81
 First, the principle of unity between officers and men, which means eradicating feudal practices in the army, prohibiting beating and abuse, building up a conscious discipline, and sharing weal and woe--as a result of which the entire army is closely united
258
 Second, the principle of unity between the army and the people, which means maintaining a discipline that forbids the slightest violation of the people's interests, conducting propaganda among the masses, organizing and arming them, lightening their financial burdens and suppressing the traitors and collaborators who do harm to the army and the people--as a result of which the army is closely united with the people and welcomed everywhere
443
 Third, the principle of disintegrating the enemy troops and giving lenient treatment to prisoners of war
105
 Our victory depends not only upon our military operations but also upon the disintegration of the enemy troops
111
 III, pp
8
 Among the prisoners, those who were coerced into joining the reactionary forces but who are more or less inclined towards the revolution should be won over in large numbers to work for our army
194
 The rest should be released and, if they fight us and are captured again, should again be set free
99
 We should not insult them, take away their personal effects or try to exact recantations from them, but without exception should treat them sincerely and kindly
161
 This should be our policy, however reactionary they may be
59
 It is a very effective way of isolating the hard core of reaction
66
 Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; it is people, not things, that are decisive
113
 The contest of strength is not only a contest of military and economic power, but also a contest of human power and morale
123
 Military and economic power is necessarily wielded by people
61
  The atom bomb is a paper tiger which the US reactionaries use to scare people
79
 It looks terrible, but in fact it isn't
40
 Of course, the atom bomb is a weapon of mass slaughter, but the outcome of a war is decided by the people, not by one or two new types of weapon
145
  Soldiers are the foundation of an army; unless they are imbued with a progressive political spirit, and unless such a spirit is fostered through progressive political work, it will be impossible to achieve genuine unity between officers and men, impossible to arouse their enthusiasm for the War of Resistance to the full, and impossible to provide a sound basis for the most effective use of all our technical equipment and tactics
434
 The purely military viewpoint is very highly developed among a number of comrades in the Red Army
98
 It manifests itself as follows:  1
35
 These comrades regard military affairs and politics as opposed to each other and refuse to recognize that military affairs are only one means of accomplishing political tasks
175
 Some even say, "If you are good militarily, naturally you are good politically; if you are not good militarily, you cannot be any good politically"--this is to go a step further and give military affairs a leading position over politics
237
 Recently there has been a falling off in ideological and political work among students and intellectuals, and some unhealthy tendencies have appeared
150
 Some people seem to think that there is no longer any need to concern themselves with politics or with the future of the motherland and the ideals of mankind
158
 It seems as if Marxism, once all the rage, is currently not so much in fashion
79
 To counter these tendencies, we must strengthen our ideological and political work
83
 Both students and intellectuals should study hard
50
 In addition to the study of their specialized subjects, they must make progress ideologically and politically, which means they should study Marxism, current events and politics
178
 Not to have a correct political orientation is like having no soul
67
  All departments and organizations should shoulder their responsibilities for ideological and political work
109
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
 After receiving political education, the Red Army soldiers have become class-conscious and learned the essentials of distributing land, setting up political power, arming the workers and peasants, etc
201
, and they all know they are fighting for themselves, for the working class and the peasantry
93
 Hence they can endure the hardships of the bitter struggle without complaint
77
 Each company, battalion or regiment has its soldiers' committee which represents the interests of the soldiers and carries on political and mass work
150
 On this basis, the army achieved greater purity in its ranks, strengthened discipline, unfolded a mass movement for training and further developed its political, economic and military democracy in a completely well-led and orderly way
235
 Thus the army has become united as one man, with everybody contributing his ideas and his strength, fearless of sacrifice and capable of overcoming material difficulties, an army which displays mass heroism and daring in destroying the enemy
242
 Such an army will be invincible
32
  In the last few months almost all the People's Liberation Army has made use of the intervals between battles for large-scale training and consolidation
153
 This has been carried out in a fully guided, orderly and democratic way
72
 It has therefore aroused the revolutionary fervour of the great masses of commanders and fighters, enabled them clearly to comprehend the aim of the war, eliminated certain incorrect ideological tendencies and undesirable manifestations in the army, educated the cadres and fighters and greatly enhanced the combat effectiveness of the army
341
 From now on, we must continue to carry on this new type of ideological education movement in the army, a movement which has a democratic and mass character
156
 It is in accordance with these essentials that the staff teach and the students study
86
  To Be Attacked by the Enemy Is Not a Bad Thing but a Good Thing (May 26, 1939), 1st pocket ed
95
  Our nation has always had a traditional style of hard struggle, which we should develop
89
  This orientation is inseperable from a style of hard struggle
63
 Without the style of hard struggle, it is impossible to maintain a firm and correct political orientation

  Be united, alert, earnest and lively

 RELATIONS BETWEEN OFFICERS AND MEN   Our army has always had two policies
74
 First, we must be ruthless to our enemies, we must overpower and annihilate them
81
 Second, we must be kind to our own, to the people, to our comrades and to our superiors and subordinates, and unite with them
126
  We hail from all corners of the country and have joined together for a common revolutionary objective
103
 And we need the vast majority of the people with us on the road to this objective
82
  Our cadres must show concern for every soldier, and all people in the revolutionary ranks must care for each other, must love and help each other
147
 III, pp
8
  A movement to support the cadres and cherish the soldiers should be launched in every army unit, calling on the cadres to chreish the soldiers and the soldiers to support the cadres
183
 They should speak up about each other's shortcomings and mistakes and quickly correct them
91
 In this way they will be able to achieve a very good internal unity
68
  Many people think that it is wrong methods that make for strained relations between officers and men and between the army and the people, but I always tell them that it is a question of basic attitude (or basic principle), of having respect for the soldiers and the people
274
 It is from this attitude that the various policies, methods and forms ensue
76
 If we depart from this attitude, then the policies, methods and forms will certainly be wrong, and the relations between officers and men and between the army and the people are bound to be unsatisfactory
205
 Our three major principles for the army's political work are, first, unity between officers and men; second, unity between the army and the people; and third, the disintegration of the enemy forces
198
 To apply these principles effectively, we must start with this basic attitude of respect for the soldiers and the people, and of respect for the human dignity of prisoners of war once they have laid down their arms
215
 Those who take all this as a technical matter and not one of basic attitude are indeed wrong, and they should correct their view
129
  Communists must use the democratic method of persuasion and education when working among the labouring people and must on no account resort to commandism or coercion
167
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
 Our comrades must understand that ideological remoulding involves long-term, patient and painstaking work, and they must not attempt to change people's ideology, which has been shaped over decades of life, by giving a few lectures or by holding a few meetings
260
 Persuasion, not coercion, is the only way to convince people
61
 Coercion will never result in convincing people
48
 To try to convince them submit by force simply won't do
56
 This kind of method is permissible in dealing with the enemy, but absolutely impermissible in dealing with comrades or friends
127
  We must make a distinction between the enemy and ourselves, and we must not adopt an antagonistic stand towards comrades and treat them as we would the enemy
159
 In speaking up, one must have an ardent desire to protect the cause of the people and raise their political consciousness, and there must be no ridiculing or attacking in one's approach
186
 RELATIONS BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE   The army must become one with the people so that they see it as their own army
123
 Such an army will be invincible 
33
  Every comrade must be helped to understand that as long as we rely on the people, believe firmly in the inexhaustible creative power of the masses and hence trust and identify ourselves with them, we can surmount any difficulty, and no enemy can crush us while we can crush any enemy
285
 Wherever our comrades go, they must build good relations with the masses, be concerned for them and help them overcome their difficulties
138
 We must unite with the masses; the more of the masses we unite with, the better
80
 In this way relations between the army and the people will become still better
79
 In the army the task of supporting the government and cherishing the people should be handled through the ideological education of every commander and fighter, so that they all thoroughly understand its importance
214
 As long as the army on its part does this job well, the local government and the people will also improve their relations with the army
136
 DEMOCRACY IN THE THREE MAIN FIELDS   A proper measure of democracy should be put into effect in the army, chiefly by abolishing the feudal practice of bullying and beating and by having officers and men share weal and woe
222
 Once this is done, unity will be achieved between officers and men, the combat effectiveness of the army will be greatly increased, and there will be no doubt of our ability to sustain the long, cruel war
205
 The officers do not beat the men; officers and men receive equal treatment, soldiers are free to hold meetings and to speak out; trivial formalities have been done away with; and the accounts are open for all to inspect 
221
 Democracy in our army is an important weapon for undermining the feudal mercenary army
87
  The policy for political work in our army units is fully to arouse the rank and file, the commanders and all working personnel in order to achieve three major objectives through a democratic movement under centralized leadership, namely, a high degree of political unity, better living conditions, and better military technique and tactics
341
 The Three Check-ups and Three Improvements [1] now being enthusiastically carried out in our army units are intended to attain the first two of these objectives through the methods of political and economic democracy
217
  With regard to economic democracy, the representatives elected by the soldiers must be ensured the right to assist (but not to bypass) the company leadership in managing the company's supplies and mess
203
  With regard to military democracy, in periods of training there must be mutual instruction as between officers and soldiers and among the soldiers themselves; and in periods of fighting the companies at the front must hold big and small meetings of various kinds
264
 Under the direction of the company leadership, the rank and file should be roused to discuss how to attack and capture enemy positions and how to fulfil other combat tasks
172
 When the fighting lasts several days, several such meetings should be held
75
 This kind of military democracy was practiced with great success in the battle of Panlung in northern Shensi and in the battle of Shihchiachuang in the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei area
177
 It has been proved that the practice can only do good and can do no harm whatsoever
84
 Selected Military Writings, 2nd ed
35
 Otherwise, "initiative" will be an empty thing
47
 Only in an atmosphere of democracy can large numbers of able people be brought forward
87
  Anyone should be allowed to speak out, whoever he may be, so long as he is not a hostile element and does not make malicous attacks, and it does not matter if he says something wrong
184
 Leaders at all levels have the duty to listen to others
56
 Two principles must be observed: (1) Say all you know and say it without reserve; (2) Don't blame the speaker but take his words as a warning
142
 Unless the principle of "Don't blame the speaker" is observed genuinely and not falsely, the result will not be "Say all you know and say it without reserve"
158
  In the sphere of theory, destroy the roots of ultra-democracy
63
 Next, it should be pointed out that the source of ultra-democracy consists in the petty bourgeoisie's individualistic aversion to discipline
141
 These ideas are utterly incompatible with the fighting tasks of the proletariat
80
 In the localities, the "Three Check-ups" meant checking on class origin, ideology and style of work; in the armed units, the check-ups were on class origin, performance of duty and will to fight
195
 The "Three Improvements" meant organizational consolidation, ideological education and rectification of style of work
118
 EDUCATION AND THE TRAINING OF TROOPS   Our educational policy must enable everyone who receives an education to develop morally, intellectually and physically and become a worker with both socialist consciousness and culture
225
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
  For a military school, the most important question is the selection of a director and instructors and the adoption of an educational policy
141
 A school of a hundred people certainly cannot be run well if it does not have a leading group of several people; or a dozen or more, which is formed in accordance with the actual circumstances (and not thrown together artificially) and is composed of the most active, upright and alert of the teachers, the other staff and the students

  All officers and fighters of our army must improve their military art, march forward courageously towards sure victory in the war and resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and completely wipe out all enemies
202
  Equal importance should be attatched to the military and political aspects of the one-year consolidation and training programme which has just begun, and the two aspects should be integrated
192
 At the start, stress should be placed on the political aspect, on improving relations between officers and men, enhancing internal unity and arousing a high level of enthusiasm among the masses of cadres and fighters
217
 Only thus will the military consolidation and training proceed smoothly and attain better results
98
  As for the method of training, we should unfold the mass training movement in which officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers and the soldiers teach each other
168
  Our slogan in training troops is, "Officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers and soldiers teach each other"
116
 The fighters have a lot of practical combat experience
55
 The officers should learn from the fighters, and when they have made other people's experience their own, they will become more capable
136
  As for the training courses, the main objective should still be to raise the level of technique in marksmanship, bayoneting, grenade-throwing and the like and the secondary objective should be to raise the level of tactics, while special emphasis should be laid on night operations
283
 The organs of state must practise democratic centralism, they must rely on the masses and their personnel must serve the people

 Comrade Bethune's spirit, his utter devotion to others without any thought of self, was shown in his great sense of responsibility in his work and his great warm-heartedness towards all comrades and the people
210
 Every Communist must learn from him
36
 We must all learn the spirit of absolute selflessness from him
63
 With this spirit everyone can be very useful to the people
59
 A man's ability may be great or small, but if he has this spirit, he is already noble-minded and pure, a man of moral integrity and above vulgar interests, a man who is of value to the people
192
 These battalions of ours are wholly dedicated to the liberation of the people and work entirely in the people's interests
122
  All our cadres, whatever their rank, are servants of the people, and whatever we do is to serve the people
108
  Our duty is to hold ourselves responsible to the people
57
 Every word, every act and every policy must conform to the people's interests, and if mistakes occur, they must be corrected -- that is what being responsible to the people means
179
   Wherever there is struggle there is sacrifice, and death is a common occurrence
82
 But we have the interests of the people and the sufferings of the great majority at heart, and when we die for the people it is a worthy death
143
 Nevertheless, we should do our best to avoid unnecessary sacrifices
68
  All men must die, but death can vary in its significance
58
" To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai, but to work for the fascists and die for the exploiters and oppressors is lighter than a feather
149
 PATRIOTISM AND INTERNATIONALISM   Can a Communist, who is an internationalist, at the same time be a patriot? We hold that he not only can be but must be
154
 The specific content of patriotism is determined by historical conditions
74
 We are at once internationalists and patriots, and our slogan is, "Fight to defend the motherland against the aggressors
121
" For us defeatism is a crime and to strive for victory in the War of Resistance is an inescapable duty
103
 For only by fighting in defence of the motherland can we defeat the aggressors and achieve national liberation
111
 And only by achieving national liberation will it be possible for the proletariat and other working people to achieve their own emancipation
141
 Thus in wars of national liberation patriotism is applied internationalism
75
 This is our internationalism, the internationalism with which we oppose both narrow nationalism and narrow patriotism
118
 In the fight for complete liberation the oppressed people rely first of all on their own struggle and then, and only then, on international assistance
151
 The people who have triumphed in their own revolution should help those still struggling for liberation
104
 This is our internationalist duty
34
  The socialist countries are states of an entirely new type in which the exploiting classes have been overthrown and the working people are in power
149
 The principle of integrating internationalism with patriotism is practised in the relations between these countries
116
 We are closely bound by common interests and common ideals
59
 in Celebration of the Great October Socialist Revolution" (November 6, 1957)
77
  The people of the countries in the socialist camp should unite, the people of the countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America should unite, the people of all the continents should unite, all peace-loving countries should unite, and all countries subjected to US aggression, control, intervention or bullying should unite, and so form the broadest united front to oppose the US imperialist policies of aggression and war and to defend world peace
447
  Things develop ceaselessly
28
 She will have become a powerful socialist industrial country
61
 And that is as it should be
28
 Her contribution over a long period has been far too small
59
 For this we are regretful
26
  However, we should be modest -- not only now, but forty-five years hence as well
82
 We should always be modest
27
  "In Commemoration of Dr
25
 Sun Yat-sen" (November 1956)
29
  We must never adopt an arrogant attitude of great-power chauvinism and become conceited because of the victory of our revolution and certain achievements in our construction
175
 Every nation, big or small, has its strong and weak points
59
 REVOLUTIONARY HEROISM   This army has an indomitable spirit and is determined to vanquish all enemies and never to yield
121
 No matter what the difficulties and hardships, so long as a single man remains, he will fight on
97
 Give full play to our style of fighting -- courage in battle, no fear of sacrifice, no fear of fatigue, and continuous fighting (that is, fighting successive battles in a short time without rest)
196
  Be resolute, fear no sacrifice and surmount every difficulty to win victory
77
 They picked themselves up, wiped off the blood, buried their fallen comrades and went into battle again
104
 You have many good qualities and have rendered great service, but you must always remember not to become conceited
115
 You are respected by all, and quite rightly, but this easily leads to conceit
78
 If you become conceited, if you are not modest and cease to exert yourselves, and if you do not respect others, do not respect the cadres and the masses, then you will cease to be heroes and models
198
 There have been such people in the past, and I hope you will not follow their example
86
  In the fight to wipe out the enemy and to restore and increase industrial and agricultural production, you have overcome many difficulties and hardships and demonstrated immense courage, wisdom and initiative
210
 BUILDING OUR COUNTRY THROUGH DILIGENCE AND FRUGALITY   We must see to it that all our cadres and all our people constantly bear in mind that ours is a large socialist country but an economically backward and poor one, and that this is a very great contradiction
262
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocked ed
95
  Diligence and thrift should be practiced in running factories, shops and all state-owned, co-operative and other enterprises
126
 The principle of diligence and frugality should be observed in everything
74
 It is the principle of economy is one of the basic principles of socialist economics
85
 Even then we still have to observe the principle of diligence and frugality
76
 But it is in the coming decades, during the present series of five-year plans, that we must particularly advocate diligence and frugality, that we must pay special attention to economy
185
  Wherever we happen to be, we must treasure our manpower and material resources, and must not take a short view and indulge in wastefulness and extravagance
157
 Wherever we are, from the very first year of our work we must bear in mind the many years to come, the protracted war that must be maintained, the counter-offensive, and the work of reconstruction after the enemy's expulsion
225
 On the one hand, never be wasteful or extravagant; on the other, actively expand production
92
 Previously, in some places people suffered a great deal because they did not take the long view and neglected economy in manpower and material resources and the expansion of production
185
 The lesson is there and attention must be called to it
55
  In order to speed up this restoration and development [of agricultural production and industrial production in small towns], we must do our utmost, in the course of our struggle for the abolition of the feudal system, to preserve all useful means of production and of livelihood, take resolute measures against anyone's destroying or wasting them, oppose extravagant eating and drinking and pay attention to thrift and economy
428
  Thrift should be the guiding principle in our government expenditure
70
 It should be made clear to all government workers that corruption and waste are very great crimes
98
 Our campaigns against corruption and waste have already achieved some results, but further efforts are required
112
 Our system of accounting must be guided by the principle of saving every copper for the war effort, for the revolutionary cause and for our economic construction
162
  A dangerous tendency has shown itself of late among many of our personnel -- an unwillingness to share the joys and hardships of the masses, a concern for personal fame and gain
179
 This is very bad
17
 One way of overcoming it is to simplify our organizations in the course of our campaign to increase production and practice economy, and to transfer cadres to lower levels so that a considerable number will return to productive work
233
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocked ed
95
  Production by the army for its own support has not only improved the army's living conditions and lightened the burden on the people, thereby making it possible further to expand the army
189
 In addition, it has had many immediate side-effects
52
 They are as follows:   (1) Improved relations between officers and men
71
 Officers and men work together  in production and become like brothers
71
    (2) Better attitude to labour
33
  since the army began to produce  for its own support, the attitude to labour has improved and loafer ways  have been overcome
127
    (3) Strengthened discipline
31
 Far from weakening discipline in battle and  in army life, labour discipline in production actually strengthens it
115
    (4) Improved relations between the army and the people
58
 Once an armed force  begins to "keep house" for itself, encroachments upon the property of the  people seldom or never occur
125
 As the army and the people exchange labour  and help each other in production, the friendship between them is strengthened
123
    (5) Less grumbling in the army about the government and improved relations  between the two
95
    (6) An impetus to the great production campaign of the people
65
 Once the army  engages in production, the need for government and other organizations to  do likewise becomes more obvious, and they do so more energetically; also,  the need for a universal campaign of the whole people to increase production  naturally becomes more obvious, and this too is carried on more energetically
322

 Some people say that if the army units go in for production, they will be unable to train or fight and that if the government and other organizations do so, they will be unable to do their own work
198
 This is a false argument
25
 In recent years our army units in the Border Region have undertaken production on a big scale to provide themselves with ample food and clothing and have simultaneously done their training and conducted their political studies and literacy and other courses much more successfully than before, and there is greater unity than ever within the army and between the army and the people
383
 While there was a large-scale production campaign at the front last year, great successes were gained in the fighting and in addition an extensive training campaign was started
177
 And thanks to production, the personnel of the government and other organizations live a better life and work with greater devotion and efficiency; this is the case both in the Border Region and at the front

 SELF-RELIANCE AND ARDUOUS STRUGGLE   On what basis should our policy rest? It should rest on our own strength, and that means regeneration through one's own efforts
165
 We are not alone; all the countries and people in the world opposed to imperialism are our friends
99
 Nevertheless, we stress regeneration through our own efforts
61
  We stand for self-reliance
28
 We hope for foreign aid but cannot be dependent on it; we depend on our own efforts, on the creative power of the whole army and the entire people
147
  To win countrywide victory is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li
86
 The comrades must be taught to remain modest, prudent and free from arrogance and rashness in their style of work
114
 The comrades must be taught to preserve the style of plain living and hard struggle
84
 We must thoroughly clear away all ideas amoung our cadres of winning easy victories through good luck, without hard and bitter struggle, without sweat and blood
161
  We should carry on constant propaganda among the people on the facts of world progress and the bright future ahead so that they will build their confidence in victory
168
 At the same time, we must tell the people and tell our comrades that there will be twists and turns in our road
112
 There are still many obstacles and difficulties along the road of revolution
77
 Some comrades do not like to think much about difficulties
59
 But difficulties are facts; we must recognize as many difficulties as there are and should not adopt a "policy of non-recognition"
131
 We must recognize difficulties, analyse them and combat them
61
 There are no straight roads in the world; we must be prepared to follow a road which twists and turns and not try to get things on the cheap
141
 It must not be imagined that one fine morning all the reactionaries will go down on their knees of their own accord
116
 In a word, while the prospects are bright, the road has twists and turns
73
 There are still many difficulties ahead which we must not overlook
67
 By uniting with the entire people in a common effort, we can certainly overcome all difficulties and win victory
113
  The wealth of society is created by the workers, peasants and working intellectuals
85
 If they take their destiny into their own hands, follow a Marxist-Leninist line and take an active attitude in solving problems instead of evading them, there will be no difficulty in the world which they cannot overcome
221
 The reactionary forces and we both have difficulties
53
 But the difficulties of the reactionary forces are insurmountable because they are forces on the verge of death and have no future
131
 Our difficulties can be overcome because we are new and rising forces and have a bright future
95
  In times of difficulty we must not lose sight of our achievements, must see the bright future and must pluck up our courage

  New things always have to experience difficulties and setbacks as they grow
77
 It is sheer fantasy to imagine that the cause of socialism is all plain sailing and easy success, without difficulties and setbacks or the exertion of tremendous efforts
170
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocked ed
95
  At certain times in the revolutionary struggle, the difficulties outweigh the favourable conditions and so constitute the principal aspect of the contradiction and the favourable conditions constitute the secondary aspect
223
 But through their efforts the revolutionaries can overcome the difficulties step by step and open up a favourable new situation; thus a difficult situation yields place to a favourable one
189
  What is work? Work is struggle
32
 There are difficulties and problems in those places for us to overcome and solve
81
 We go there to work and struggle to overcome these difficulties
64
 A good comrade is one who is more eager to go where the difficulties are greater
81
 His house faced south and beyond his doorway stood the two great peaks, Taihang and Wangwu, obstructing the way
112
 He called his sons, and hoe in hand they began to dig up these mountains with great determination
98
 Another graybeard, known as the Wise Old Man, saw them and said derisively, "How silly of you to do this! It is quite impossible for you few to dig up those two huge mountains
176
" The Foolish Old Man replied, "When I die, my sons will carry on; when they die, there will be my grandsons, and then their sons and grandsons, and so on to infinity
166
 High as they are, the mountains cannot grow any higher and with every bit we dig, they will be that much lower
111
 Why can't we clear them away?" Having refuted the Wise Old Man's wrong view, he went on digging every day, unshaken in his conviction
134
 God was moved by this, and he sent down two angels, who carried the mountains away on their backs
98
 One is imperialism, the other is feudalism
43
 We must persevere and work unceasingly, and we, too, will touch God's heart
76
 METHODS OF THINKING AND METHODS OF WORK   The history of mankind is one of continuous development from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom
150
 This process is never-ending
29
 In any society in which classes exist class struggle will never end
68
 In classless society the struggle between the new and the old and between truth and falsehood will never end
109
 In the fields of the struggle for production and scientific experiment, mankind makes constant progress and nature undergoes constant change; they never remain at the same level
178
 Therefore, man has constantly to sum up experience and go on discovering, inventing, creating and advancing
108
 Ideas of stagnation, pessimism inertia and complacency are all wrong
69
 They are wrong because they agree neither with the historical facts of social development over the past million years, nor with the historical facts of nature so far known to us (ie, nature as revealed in the history of celestial bodies, the earth, life, and other natural phenomena)
284
  Natural science is one of man's weapons in his fight for freedom
66
 For the purpose of attaining freedom in society, man must use social science to understand and change society and carry out social revolution
142
 For the purpose of attaining freedom in the world of nature, man must use natural science to understand, conquer and change nature and thus attain freedom from nature
167
  The Marxist philosophy of dialectical materialism has two outstanding characteristics
87
 One is its class nature: it openly avows that dialectical materialism is in the service of the proletariat
107
 The other is its practicality: it emphasizes the dependence of theory on practice, emphasizes that theory is based on practice and in turn serves practice
155
  Marxist philosophy holds that the most important problem does not lie in understanding the laws of the objective world and thus being able to explain it, but in applying the knowledge of these laws actively to change the world
228
  Where do correct ideas come from? Do they drop from the skies? No
67
 Are they innate in the mind? No
32
 They come from social practice, and from it alone; they come from three kinds of social practice, the struggle for production, the class struggle and scientific experiment
172
  Where Do Correct Ideas Come From? (May 1963), 1st pocket ed
61
  It is man's social being that determines his thinking
55
 Once the correct ideas characteristic of the advanced class are grasped by the masses, these ideas turn into a material force which changes society and changes the world
170
  In their social practice, men engage in various kinds of struggle and gain rich experience, both from their successes and from their failures
143
 Countless phenomena of the objective external world are reflected in a man's brain through his five sense organs&#151; the organs of sight, heating, smell, taste and touch
172
 At first, knowledge is perceptual
34
 The leap to conceptual knowledge, ie, to ideas, occurs when sufficient perceptual knowledge is accumulated
107
 This is one process in cognition
33
 It is the first stage in the whole process of cognition, the stage leading from objective matter to subjective consciousness, from existence to ideas
150
 Whether or not one's consciousness or ideas (including theories, policies, plans or measures) do correctly reflect the laws of the objective external world is not yet proved at this stage, in which it is not yet possible to ascertain whether they are correct or not
266
 Then comes the second stage in the process of cognition, the stage leading from consciousness back to matter, from ideas back to existence, in which the knowledge gained in the first stage is applied in social practice to ascertain whether the theories, policies, plans or measures meet with the anticipated success
316
 Generally speaking, those that succeed are correct and those that fail are incorrect, and this is especially true of man's struggle with nature
144
 In social struggle, the forces representing the advanced class sometimes suffer defeat not because their ideas are incorrect but because, in the balance of forces engaged in struggle, they are not as powerful for the time being as the forces of reaction; they are therefore temporarily defeated, but they are bound to triumph sooner or later
342
 Man's knowledge makes another leap through the test of practice
64
 This leap is more important than the previous one
50
 For it is this leap alone that can prove the correctness or incorrectness of the first leap in cognition, ie, of the ideas, theories, policies, plans or measures formulated in the course of reflecting the objective external world
230
 There is no other way of testing truth
39
 Often, correct knowledge can be arrived at only after many repetitions of the process leading from matter to consciousness and then back to matter, that is, leading from practice to knowledge and then back to practice
218
 Such is the Marxist theory of knowledge, the dialectical materialist theory of knowledge
89
 Whoever wants to know a thing has no way of doing so except by coming into contact with it, that is, by living (practising) in its environment
143
 If you want knowledge, you must take part in the practice of changing reality
78
 If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear by eating it yourself
88
  If you want to know the theory and methods of revolution, you must take part in revolution
92
 All genuine knowledge originates in direct experience
54
 299- 300
9
  Knowledge begins with practice, and theoretical knowledge is acquired through practice and must then return to practice
121
 The active function of knowledge manifests itself not only in the active leap from perceptual to rational knowledge, but--and this is more important--it must manifest itself in the leap from rational knowledge to revolutionary practice
236
 It is well known that when you do anything, unless you understand its actual circumstances, its nature and its relations to other things, you will not know the laws governing it, or know how to do it, or be able to do it well
226
  If a man wants to succeed in his work, that is, to achieve the anticipated results, he must bring his ideas into correspondence with the laws of the objective external world; if they do not correspond, he will fail in his practice
232
 After he fails, he draws his lessons, corrects his ideas to make them correspond to the laws of the external world, and can thus turn failure into success; this is what is meant by "failure is the mother of success" and "a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit"
262
 296- 97
8
  We are Marxists, and Marxism teaches that in our approach to a problem we should start from objective facts, not from abstract definitions, and that we should derive our guiding principles, policies and measures from an analysis of these facts
245
  The most fundamental method of work which all Communists must firmly bear in mind is to determine our working policies according to actual conditions
151
 When we study the causes of the mistakes we have made, we find that they all arose because we departed from the actual situation at a given time and place and were subjective in our working policies
199
 Idealism and metaphysics are the easiest things in the world, because people can talk as much nonsense as they like without basing it on objective reality or having it tested against reality
191
 Materialism and dialectics, on the other hand, need effort
59
 They must be based on and tested by objective reality
54
 Unless one makes the effort, one is liable to slip into idealism and metaphysics
81
  When we look at a thing, we must examine its essence and treat its appearance merely as an usher at the threshold, and once we cross the threshold, we must grasp the essence of the thing; this is the only reliable and scientific method of analysis
249
  The fundamental cause of the development of a thing is not external but internal; it lies in the contradictoriness within the thing
133
 There is internal contradiction in every single thing, hence its motion and development
88
 Contradictoriness within a thing is the fundamental cause of its development, while its interrelations and interactions with other things are secondary causes
159
 It [materialist dialectics] holds that external causes are the condition of change and internal causes are the basis of change, and that external causes become operative through internal causes
194
 In a suitable temperature an egg changes into a chicken, but no temperature can change a stone into a chicken, because each has a different basis
146
  Marxist philosophy holds that the law of the unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the universe
104
 This law operates universally, whether in the natural world, in human society, or in man's thinking
100
 Between the opposites in a contradiction there is at once unity and struggle, and it is this that impels things to move and change
131
 Contradictions exist everywhere, but they differ in accordance with the different nature of different things
109
 In any given phenomenon or thing, the unity of opposites is conditional, temporary and transitory, and hence relative, whereas the struggle of opposites is absolute
165
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
  The analytical method is dialectical
38
 By analysis, we mean analysing the contradictions in things
60
 And sound analysis is impossible without intimate knowledge of life and without real understanding of the pertinent contradictions
131
  Concrete analysis of concrete conditions, Lenin said, is "the most essential thing in Marxism, the living soul of Marxism"
124
 Lacking an analytical approach, many of our comrades do not want to go deeply into complex matters, to analyse and study them over and over again, but like to draw simple conclusions which are either absolutely affirmative or absolutely negative
246
  From now on we should remedy this state of affairs
52
  The way these comrades look at problems is wrong
50
 They do not look at the essential or main aspects but emphasize the non-essential or minor ones
96
 It should be pointed out that these non-essential or minor aspects must not be overlooked and must be dealt with one by one
124
 But they should not be taken as the essential or main aspects, or we will lose our bearings
92
  On the Question of of Agricultural Co-operation (July 31, 1955), 3rd ed
73
  In this world, things are complicated and are decided by many factors
71
 We should look at problems from different aspects, not from just one
69
  Only those who are subjective, one-sided and superficial in their approach to problems will smugly issue orders or directives the moment they arrive on the scene, without considering the circumstances, without viewing things in their totality (their history and their present state as a whole) and without getting to the essence of things (their nature and the internal relations between one thing and another)
412
 Such people are bound to trip and fall
39
  "On Practice
14
  In studying a problem, we must shun subjectivity, one-sidedness and superficiality
84
 To be subjective means not to look at problems objectively, that is, not to use the materialist viewpoint in looking at problems
129
 I have discussed this in my essay "On Practice"
48
 To be one-sided means not to look at problems all-sidedly
58
  Or it may be called seeing the part but not the whole, seeing the trees but not the forest
92
 When Sun Wu Tzu said in discussing military science, "Know the enemy and know yourself, and you can fight a hundred battles with no danger of defeat", he was referring to the two sides in a battle
197
 Wei Chengi of the Tang Dynasty also understood the error of one-sidedness when he said, "Listen to both sides and you will be enlightened, heed only one side and you will be benighted
184
" But our comrades often look at problems one-sidedly, and so they often run into snags
87
  Lenin said:    in order really to know an object we must embrace, study, all its sides,  all connections and "mediations"
123
 We shall never achieve this completely,  but the demand for all-sidedness is a safeguard against mistakes and rigidity
119
   We should remember his words
31
 To be superficial means to consider neither the characteristics of a contradiction in its totality nor the characteristics of each of its aspects; it means to deny the necessity for probing deeply into a thing and minutely studying the characteristics of its contradiction, but instead merely to look from afar and, after glimpsing the rough outline, immediately to try to resolve the contradiction (to answer a question, settle a dispute, handle work, or direct a military operation)
485
 This way of doing things is bound to lead to trouble
53
  To be one-sided and superficial is at the same time to be subjective
70
 For all objective things are actually interconnected and are governed by inner laws, but instead of undertaking the task of reflecting things as they really are some people only look at things one-sidedly or superficially and who know neither their interconnections nor their inner laws, and so their method is subjectivist
324
 One-sidedness means thinking in terms of absolutes, that is, a metaphysical approach to problems
97
 In the appraisal of our work, it is one-sided to regard everything either as all positive or as all negative
109
  To regard everything as positive is to see only the good and not the bad, and to tolerate only praise and no criticism
120
 To talk as though our work is good in every respect is at variance with the facts
82
 It is not true that everything is good; there are still shortcomings and mistakes
82
 But neither is it true that everything is bad, and that, too, is at variance with the facts
92
 Here analysis is necessary
27
 To negate everything is to think, without having made any analysis, that nothing has been done well and that the great work of socialist construction, the great struggle in which hundreds of millions of people are participating, is a complete mess with nothing in it worth commending
284
 Although there is a difference between the many people who hold such views and those who are hostile to the socialist system, these views are very mistaken and harmful and can only dishearten people
199
 It is wrong to appraise our work either from the viewpoint that everything is positive, or from the viewpoint that everything is negative
138
 In approaching a problem a Marxist should see the whole as well as the parts
77
 A frog in a well says, "The sky is no bigger than the mouth of the well
72
" That is untrue, for the sky is not just the size of the mouth of the well
75
 If it said, "A part of the sky is the size of the mouth of a well" that would be true, for it tallies with the facts
117
  We must learn to look at problems all-sidedly, seeing the reverse as well as the obverse side of things
105
 In given conditions, a bad thing can lead to good results and good thing to bad results

  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
 While we recognize that in the general development of history the material determines the mental and social being determines social consciousness, we also--and indeed must--recognize the reaction of mental on material things, of social consciousness on social being and of the superstructure on the economic base
313
 This does not go against materialism; on the contrary, it avoids mechanical materialism and firmly upholds dialectical materialism
131
 In seeking victory, those who direct a war cannot overstep the limitations imposed by the objective conditions; within these limitations, however, they can and must play a dynamic role in striving for victory
209
 The stage of action for commanders in a war must be built upon objective possibilities, but on that stage they can direct the performance of many a drama, full of sound and colour, power and grandeur
200
  People must adapt their thinking to the changed conditions
60
 Of course no one should go off into wild flights of fancy, or make plans of action unwarranted by the objective situation, or stretch for the impossible
153
 The problem today, however, is that Rightist conservative thinking is still causing mischief in many spheres and preventing the work in these spheres from keeping pace with the development of the objective situation
216
 The present problem is that many people consider it impossible to accomplish things which could be accomplished if they exerted themselves
139
  We should always use our brains and think everything over carefully
69
 A common saying goes, "Knit the brows and you will hit upon a stratagem
72
" In other words, much thinking yields wisdom
45

 If in any process there are a number of contradictions, one of them must be the principal contradiction playing the leading and decisive role, while the rest occupy a secondary and subordinate position
202
 Therefore, in studying any complex process in which there are two or more contradictions, we must devote every effort to funding its principal contradiction
157
 Once this principal contradiction is grasped, all problems can be readily solved
81
 Of the two contradictory aspects, one must be principal and the other secondary
80
 The principal aspect is the one playing the leading role in the contradiction
78
 The nature of a thing is determined mainly by the principal aspect of a contradiction, the aspect which has gained the dominant position
137
  But this situation is not static; the principal and the non-principal aspects of a contradiction transform themselves into each other and the nature of the thing changes accordingly
183
  It is not enough to set tasks, we must also solve the problem of the methods for carrying them out
100
 If our task is to cross a river, we cannot cross it without a bridge or a boat
79
 Unless the bridge or boat problem is solved, it is idle to speak of crossing the river
87
 Unless the problem of method is solved, talk about the task is useless
71
  In any task, if no general and widespread call is issued, the broad masses cannot be mobilized for action
107
 But if persons in leading positions confine themselves to a general call--if they do not personally, in some of the organizations, go deeply and concretely into the work called for, make a break-through at some single point, gain experience and use this experience for guiding other units--then they will have no way of testing the correctness or of enriching the content of their general call, and there is the danger that nothing may come of it
447
  No one in a leading position is competent to give general guidance to all the units unless he derives concrete experience from particular individuals and events in particular subordinate units
194
 This method must be promoted everywhere so that leading cadres at all levels learn to apply it
95
  In any given place, there cannot be a number of central tasks at the same time
80
 At any one time there can be only one central task, supplemented by other tasks of a second or third order of importance
121
 Consequently, the person with over-all responsibility in the locality must take into account the history and circumstances of the struggle there and put the different tasks in their proper order; he should not act upon each instruction as it comes from the higher organization without any planning of his own, and thereby create a multitude of "central tasks" and a state of confusion and disorder
398
 Nor should a higher organization simultaneously assign many tasks to a lower organization without indicating their relative importance and urgency or without specifying which is central, for that will lead to confusion in the steps to be taken by the lower organizations in their work and thus no definite results will be achieved
331
 It is part of the art of leadership to take the whole situation into account and plan accordingly in the light of the historical conditions and existing circumstances of each locality, decide correctly on the centre of gravity and the sequence of the work for each period, steadfastly carry through the decision, and make sure that definite results are achieved
362
 Waiting leads to great loss, while correcting mistakes as soon as they occur reduces loss
90
  Don't wait until problems pile up and cause a lot of trouble before trying to solve them
90
 Leaders must march ahead of the movement, not lag behind it
60
  What we need is an enthusiatic but calm state of mind and intense but orderly work
84
 INVESTIGATION AND STUDY   Everyone engaged in practical work must investigate conditions at the lower levels
109
 Such investigation is especially necessary for those who know theory but do not know the actual conditions, for otherwise they will not be able to link theory with practice
173
 Although my assertion, "No investigation, no right to speak", has been ridiculed as "narrow empiricism", to this day I do not regret having made it; what is more, I still insist that without investigation there cannot possibly be any right to speak
249
 There are many people who "the moment they alight from the official carriage" make a hullabaloo, spout opinions, criticize this and condemn that; but, in fact, ten out of ten of them will meet with failure
206
 For such views or criticisms, which are not based on thorough investigation, are nothing but ignorant twaddle
110
 Stalin rightly says that "theory becomes purposeless if it is not connected with revolutionary practice"
105
 And he rightly adds that "practice gropes in the dark if its path is not illumined by revolutionary theory"
108
 Nobody should be labelled a "narrow empiricist" except the "practical man" who gropes in the dark and lacks perspective and foresight
134
 To take such an attitude is to seek truth from facts
53
 "Facts" are all the things that exist objectively, "truth" means their internal relations, that is, the laws governing them, and "to seek" means to study
154
 We should proceed from the actual conditions inside and outside the country, the province, county or district, and derive from them, as our guide to action, laws which are inherent in them and not imaginary, that is, we should find the internal relations of the events occurring around us
289
 And in order to do that we must rely not on subjective imagination, not on momentary enthusiasm, not on lifeless books, but on facts that exist objectively; we must appropriate the material in detail and, guided by the general principles of Marxism-Leninism, draw correct conclusions from it
292
 III, pp
8
 Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin have taught us that it is necessary to study conditions conscientiously and to proceed from objective reality and not from subjective wishes; but many of our comrades act in direct violation of this truth
236
  You can't solve a problem? Well, get down and investigate the present facts and its past history! When you have investigated the problem thoroughly, you will know how to solve it
180
 Conclusions invariably come after investigation, and not before
64
 Only a block-head cudgels his brains on his own, or together with a group, to "find a soltuion" or "evolve an idea" without making any investigation
149
 It must be stressed that this cannot possibly lead to any effective solution or any good idea
94
  Oppose Book Worship (May 1930), 1st pocked ed
47
  Investigation may be likened to the long months of pregnancy, and solving a problem to the day of birth
105
 To investigate a problem is, indeed to solve it
48
  [With the Marxist-Leninist attitude,] a person applies the theory and method of Marxism-Leninism to the systematic and thorough investigation and study of the environment
172
 He does not work by enthusiasm alone but, as Stalin says, combines revolutionary sweep with practicalness
106
  The only way to know conditions is to make social investigations, to investigate the conditions of each social class in real life
131
 For those charged with directing work, the basic method for knowing conditions is to concentrate on a few cities and villages according to a plan, use the fundamental viewpoint of Marxism, ie, the method of class analysis, and make a number of thorough investigations
268
 A fact-finding meeting need not be large; from three to five or seven or eight people are enough
97
 Ample time must be allowed and an outline for the investigation must be prepared; furthermore, one must personally ask questions, take notes and have discussions with those at the meeting
188
 Therefore one certainly cannot make an investigation, or do it well, without zeal, a determination to direct one's eyes downward and a thirst for knowledge, and without shedding the ugly mantle of pretentiousness and becoming a willing pupil
242
  A commander's correct dispositions stem from his correct decisions, his correct decisions stem from his correct judgements, and his correct judgements stem from a thorough and necessary reconnaissance and from pondering on and piecing together the data of various kinds gathered through reconnaissance
303
 He applies all possible and necessary methods of reconnaissance, and ponders on the information gathered about the enemy's situation, discarding the dross and selecting the essential, eliminating the false and retaining the true, proceeding from the one to the other and from the outside to the inside; then, he takes the conditions on his own side into account, and makes a study of both sides and their interrelations, thereby forming his judgements, making up his mind and working out his plans
498
 Such is the complete process of knowing a situation which a military man goes through before he formulates a strategic plan, a campaign plan or a battle plan
158
 CORRECTING MISTAKEN IDEAS   Even if we achieve gigantic successes in our work, there is no reason whatsoever to feel conceited and arrogant
140
 Modesty helps one to go forward, whereas conceit makes one lag behind
70
 This is a truth we must always bear in mind
44
 With victory, the people will be grateful to us and the bourgeoisie will come forward to flatter us
100
 It has been proved that the enemy cannot conquer us by force of arms
69
 However, the flattery of the bourgeoisie may conquer the weak-willed in our ranks
82
 There may be some Communists, who were not conquered by enemies with guns and were worthy of the name of heroes for standing up to these enemies, but who cannot withstand sugar-coated bullets; they will be defeated by sugar-coated bullets
239
 We must guard against such a situation
39
  Many things may become baggage, may become encumbrances, if we cling to them blindly and uncritically
103
 Let us take some illustrations
31
 Having made mistakes, you may feel that, come what may, you are saddled with them and so become dispirited if you have not made mistakes, you may feel that you are free from error and so become conceited
204
 Lack of achievement in work may breed pessimism and depression, while achievement may breed pride and arrogance
112
 A comrade with a short record of struggle may shirk responsibility on this account, while a veteran may become opinionated because of his long record of struggle
162
 Worker and peasant comrades, because of pride in their class origin, may look down upon intellectuals, while intellectuals, because they have a certain amount of knowledge, may look down upon workers and peasants
213
 Any specialized skill may be capitalized on and so may lead to arrogance and contempt of others
96
 Even one's age may become ground for conceit
45
 The young, because they are bright and capable, may look down upon the old; and the old, because they are rich in experience, may look down upon the young
155
 All such things become encumbrances or baggage if there is no critical awareness
81
  the army must endeavour to eradicate such faults
50
 Hard work is like a load placed before us, challenging us to shoulder it
73
 Some loads are light, some heavy
33
 Some people prefer the light to the heavy; they pick the light and leave the heavy to others
93
 That is not a good attitude
28
 Some comrades are different; they leave ease and comfort to others and carry the heavy loads themselves; they are the first to bear hardships, the last to enjoy comforts
170
 They are good comrades
23
 We should all learn from their communist spirit
48
 There are not a few people who are irresponsible in their work, preferring the light to the heavy, shoving the heavy loads on to others and choosing the easy ones for themselves
178
 At every turn they think of themselves before others
53
 When they make some small contribution, they swell with pride and brag about it for fear that others will not know
115
 They feel no warmth towards comrades and the people but are cold, indifferent and apathetic
92
 In truth such people are not Communists, or at least cannot be counted as true Communists
90
 What are these people after? They are after fame and position and want to be in the limelight
94
 Whenever they are put in charge of a branch of work, they assert their "independence"
86
 It is their dishonesty that causes them to come to grief
57
 I believe we should do things honestly, for without an honest attitude it is absolutely impossible to accomplish anything in this world
136
  They [Communists] must grasp the principle of subordinating the needs of the part to the needs of the whole
109
 If a proposal appears feasible for a partial situation but not for the situation as a whole, then the part must give way to the whole
134
 Conversely, if the proposal is not feasible for the part but is feasible in the light of the situation as a whole, again the part must give way to the whole
157
 This is what is meant by considering the situation as a whole
62
  Pleasure-seeking
18
 In the Red Army there are also quite a few people whose individualism finds expression in pleasure-seeking
107
 They always hope that their unit will march into big cities
60
 They want to go there not to work but to enjoy themselves
58
 The last thing they want is to work in the Red areas where life is hard
72
  We must oppose the tendency towards selfish departmentalism by which the interests of one's own unit are looked after to the exclusion of those of others
155
 Whoever is indifferent to the difficulties of others, refuses to transfer cadres to other units on request, or releases only the inferior ones, "using the neighbour's field as an outlet for his overflow", and does not give the slightest consideration to other departments, localities or people--such a person is a selfish departmentalist who has entirely lost the spirit of communism
384
 Lack of consideration for the whole and complete indifference to other departments, localities and people are characteristics of a selfish departmentalist
155
 We must intensify our efforts to educate such persons and to make them understand that selfish departmentalism is a sectarian tendency which will become very dangerous, if allowed to develop
191
  Liberalism manifests itself in various ways
45
  To let things slide for the sake of peace and friendship when a person has clearly gone wrong, and refrain from principled argument because he is an old acquaintance, a fellow townsman, a schoolmate, a close friend, a loved one, an old colleague or old subordinate
266
 Or to touch on the matter lightly instead of going into it thoroughly, so as to keep on good terms
99
 The result is that both the organization and the individual are harmed
71
 This is one type of liberalism
31
  To indulge in irresponsible criticism in private instead of actively putting forward one's suggestions to the organization
124
 To say nothing to people to their faces but to gossip behind their backs, or to say nothing at a meeting but to gossip afterwards
130
 To show no regard at all for the principles of collective life but to follow one's own inclination
99
 This is a second type
22
  To let things drift if they do not affect one personally; to say as little as possible while knowing perfectly well what is wrong, to be worldly wise and play safe and seek only to avoid blame
194
 This is a third type
21
  Not to obey orders but to give pride of place to one's own opinions
69
 To demand special consideration from the organization but to reject its discipline
83
 This is a fourth type
22
  To indulge in personal attacks, pick quarrels, vent personal spite or seek revenge instead of entering into an argument and struggling against incorrect views for the sake of unity or progress or getting the work done properly
228
 This is a fifth type
21
  To hear incorrect views without rebutting them and even to hear counter-revolutionary remarks without reporting them, but instead to take them calmly as if nothing had happened
178
 This is a sixth type
21
  To be among the masses and fail to conduct propaganda and agitation or speak at meetings or conduct investigations and inquiries among them, and instead to be indifferent to them and show no concern for their well-being, forgetting that one is a Communist and behaving as if one were an ordinary non-Communist
311
 This is a seventh type
23
  To see someone harming the interests of the masses and yet not feel indignant, or dissuade or stop him or reason with him, but to allow him to continue
153
 This is an eighth type
23
  To work half-heartedly without a definite plan or direction; to work perfunctorily and muddle along--"So long as one remains a monk, one goes on tolling the bell
163
" This is a ninth type
22
  To regard oneself as having rendered great service to the revolution, to pride oneself on being a veteran, to disdain minor assignments while being quite unequal to major tasks, to be slipshod in work and slack in study
221
 This is a tenth type
21
  To be aware of one's own mistakes and yet make no attempt to correct them, taking a liberal attitude towards oneself
118
 This is an eleventh type
25
  Liberalism is extremely harmful in a revolutionary collective
63
 It is a corrosive which eats away unity, undermines cohesion, causes apathy and creates dissension
99
 It is an extremely bad tendency
32
  People who are liberals look upon the principles of Marxism as abstract dogma
79
 They approve of Marxism, but are not prepared to practice it or to practice it in full; they are not prepared to replace their liberalism by Marxism
149
 These people have their Marxism, but they have their liberalism as well--they talk Marxism but practice liberalism; they apply Marxism to others but liberalism to themselves
174
 They keep both kinds of goods in stock and find a use for each
63
 This is how the minds of certain people work
45
  The people's state protects the people
40
 Only when the people have such a state can they educate and remould themselves by democratic methods on a country-wide scale, with everyone taking part, and shake off the influence of domestic and foreign reactionaries (which is still very strong, will survive for a long time and cannot be quickly destroyed), rid themselves of the bad habits and ideas acquired in the old society, not allow themselves to be led astray by the reactionaries, and continue to advance -- to advance towards a socialist and communist society
523
 It is not hard for one to do a bit of good
43
 What is hard is to do good all one's life and never do anything bad, to act consistently in the interests of the broad masses, the young people and the revolution, and to engage in arduous struggle for decades on end
217
 UNITY   The unification of our country, the unity of our people and the unity of our various nationalities -- these are the basic guarantees for the sure triumph of our cause
175
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
 To elaborate, that means starting from the desire for unity, resolving contradictions through criticism or struggle, and arriving at a new unity on a new basis
160
 In our experience this is the correct method of resolving contradictions among the people
90
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
  This [our] army has achieved remarkable unity in its own ranks and with those outside its ranks
97
 Internally, there is unity between officers and men, between the higher and lower ranks, and between military work, political work and rear service work, and externally, there is unity between the army and the people, between the army and government organizations, and between our army and the friendly armies
310
 It is imperative to overcome anything that impairs this unity
62
 DISCIPLINE   Within the ranks of the people, democracy is correlative with centralism and freedom with discipline
114
 They are the two opposites of a single entity, contradictory as well as united, and we should not one-sidedly emphasize one to the denial of the other
151
 Within the ranks of the people, we cannot do without freedom, nor can we do without discipline; we cannot do without democracy, nor can we do without centralism
161
 This unity of democracy and centralism, of freedom and discipline, constitutes our democratic centralism
105
 Under this system, the people enjoy broad democracy and freedom, but at the same time they have to keep within the bounds of socialist discipline

 If the view of the minority has been rejected, it must support the decision passed by the majority
99
 If necessary, it can bring up the maker for reconsideration at the next meeting, but apart from that it must not act against the decision in any way
149
  The Three Main Rules of Discipline are as follows:   (1) Obey orders in all your actions
90
  (2) Don't take a single needle or piece of thread from the masses
67
  (3) Turn in everything captured
33
   The Eight Points for Attention are as follows:   (1) Speak politely
70
  (2) Pay fairly for what you buy
33
  (3) Return everything you borrow
34
  (4) Pay for anything you damage
33
  (5) Do not hit or swear at people
35
  (6) Do not damage crops
25
  (7) Do not take liberties with women
38
  (8) Do not ill-treat captives
31
  They [all officers and soldiers of our army] must heighten their sense of discipline and resolutely carry out orders, carry out policy, carry out the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention -- with army and people united, army and government united, officers and soldiers united, and the whole army united -- and permit no breach of discipline
371
  Thoroughgoing materialists are fearless; we hope that all our fellow fighters will courageously shoulder their responsibilities and overcome all difficulties, fearing no setbacks or gibes, nor hesitating to criticize us Communists and give us their suggestions
262
 "He who is not afraid of death by a thousand cuts dares to unhorse the emperor" -- this is the dauntless spirit needed in our struggle to build socialism and communism
168
  We have the Marxist-Leninist weapon of criticism and self-criticism
69
 We can get rid of a bad style and keep the good
48
 As we say, dust will accumulate if a room is not cleaned regularly, our faces will get dirty if they are not washed regularly
126
 The proverb "Running water is never stale and a door-hinge is never worm-eaten" means that constant motion prevents the inroads of germs and other organisms
157
 III, pp
8
 Every Communist and revolutionary should take up this weapon
61
 The mistakes of the past must be exposed without sparing anyone's sensibilities; it is necessary to analyse and criticize what was bad in the past with a scientific attitude so that work in the future will be done more carefully and done better
245
 This is what is meant by "learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones"
73
 But our aim in exposing errors and criticizing shortcomings, like that of a doctor curing a sickness, is solely to save the patient and not to doctor him to death
163
 A person with appendicitis is saved when the surgeon removes his appendix
74
 So long as a person who has made mistakes does not hide his sickness for fear of treatment or persist in his mistakes until he is beyond cure, so long as he honestly and sincerely wishes to be cured and to mend his ways, we should welcome him and cure his sickness so that he can become a good comrade
302
 We can never succeed if we just let ourselves go, and lash out at him
70
 In treating an ideological or a political malady, one must never be rough and rash but must adopt the approach of "curing the sickness to save the patient", which is the only correct and effective method
204
 They do not understand that the main task of criticism is to point out political and organizational mistakes
109
 As to personal shortcomings, unless they are related to political and organizational mistakes, there is no need to be overcritical and to embarrass the comrades concerned
171
 This is a manifestation of petty-bourgeois individualism
57
  If we have shortcomings, we are not afraid to have them pointed out and criticized, because we serve the people
113
 Anyone, no matter who, may point out our shortcomings
54
 If he is right, we will correct them
37
 If what he proposes will benefit the people, we will act upon it
65
 We must not be complacent over any success
43
 We should check our complacency and constantly criticize our shortcomings, just as we should wash our faces or sweep the floor every day to remove the dirt and keep them clean
176
 As for criticism, do it in good time; don't get into the habit of criticizing only after the event
99
  On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation (July 31, 1955), 3rd ed
70
  Taught by mistakes and setbacks, we have become wiser and handle our affairs better
85
 It is hard for any political party or person to avoid mistakes, but we should make as few as possible
102
 Once a mistake is made, we should correct it, and the more quickly and thoroughly the better
93
 Only thus can he be considered a Communist
43
 Every comrade must be brought to understand that the supreme test of the words and deeds of a Communist is whether they conform with the highest interests and enjoy the support of the overwhelming majority of the people
220
 III, pp
8
 At no time and in no circumstances should a Communist place his personal interests first; he should subordinate them to the interests of the nation and of the masses
166
 Hence, selfishness, slacking, corruption, seeking the limelight, and so on, are most contemptible, while selflessness, working with all one's energy, whole-hearted devotion to public duty, and quiet hard work will command respect
230
  Communists must be ready at all times to stand up for the truth, because truth is in the interests of the people; Communists must be ready at all times to correct their mistakes, because mistakes are against the interests of the people
237
 III, pp
8
  Communists must always go into the whys and wherefores of anything, use their own heads and carefully think over whether or not it corresponds to reality and is really well founded; on no account should they follow blindly and encourage slavishness
250
 III, pp
8
  We should encourage comrades to take the interests of the whole into account
78
  Communists should set an example in being practical as well as far-sighted
76
 For only by being practical can they fulfil the appointed tasks, and only far-sightedness can prevent them from losing their bearings in the march forward
155
  Communists should be the most far-sighted, the most self-sacrificing, the most resolute, and the least prejudiced in sizing up situations, and should rely on the majority of the masses and win their support
208
 Communists should therefore set an example in study; at all times they should be pupils of the masses as well as their teachers
128
 Every Communist working in the mass movements should be a friend of the masses and not a boss over them, an indefatigable teacher and not a bureacratic politician
163
  Communists must never separate themselves from the majority of the people or neglect them by leading only a few progressive contingents in an isolated and rash advance, but must take care to forge close links between the progressive elements and the broad masses
264
 This is what is meant by thinking in terms of the majority
59
 We Communists are like seeds and the people are like the soil
62
 Wherever we go, we must unite with the people, take root and blossom among them
80
  We Communists must be able to integrate ourselves with the masses in all things
81
 We Communists ought to face the world and brave the storm, the great world of mass struggle and the mighty storm of mass struggle
130
  The exemplary vanguard role of the Communists is of vital importance
70
 Communists in the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies should set an example in fighting bravely, carrying out orders, observing discipline, doing political work and fostering internal unity and solidarity
204
 A Communist must never be opinionated or domineering, thinking that he is good in everything while others are good in nothing; he must never shut himself up in his little room, or brag and boast and lord it over others
219
 If what they say is right, we ought to welcome it, and we should learn from their strong points; if it is wrong, we should let them finish what they are saying and then patiently explain things to them
202
  The attitude of Communists towards any person who has made mistakes in his work should be one of persuasion in order to help him change and start afresh and not one of exclusion, unless he is incorrigible
206
  As for people who are politically backward, Communists should not slight or despise them, but should befriend them, unite with them, convince them and encourage them to go forward
181
 It is a question of fundamental importance to the proletarian revolutionary cause for a hundred, a thousand, nay ten thousand years
132
 We must shatter these imperialist prophecies
45
 From our highest organizations down to the grass-roots, we must everywhere give constant attention to the training and upbringing of successors to the revolutionary cause
171
  What are the requirements for worthy successors to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat?  They must be genuine Marxist-Leninists and not revisionists like Khrushchov wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism
211
  They must be proletarian statesmen capable of uniting and working together with the overwhelming majority
107
 Not only must they unite with those who agree with them, they must also be good at uniting with those who disagree and even with those who formerly opposed them and have since been proved wrong
194
  They must be modest and prudent and guard against arrogance and impetuosity; they must be imbued with the spirit of self-criticism and have the courage to correct mistakes and shortcomings in their work
204
 They must not cover up their errors like Khrushchov, and claim all the credit for themselves and shift all the blame on others
127
  Successors to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat come forward in mass struggles and are tempered in the great storms of revolution
140
 It is essential to test and know cadres and choose and train successors in the long course of mass struggle
108
 Cadres are a decisive factor, once the political line is determined
68
 Therefore, it is our fighting task to train large numbers of new cadres in a planned way
89
 This is what "appointing people on their merit" means
54
  It is necessary to maintain the system of cadre participation in collective productive labour
95
 By taking part in collective productive labour, the cadres maintain extensive, constant and close ties with the working people
127
 This is a major measure of fundamental importance for a socialist system; it helps to overcome bureaucracy and to prevent revisionism and dogmatism
148
 We must know how to judge cadres
33
 We must not confine our judgement to a short period or a single incident in a cadre's life, but should consider his life and work as a whole
141
 This is the principal method of judging cadres
47
  We must know how to use cadres well
37
 In the final analysis, leadership involves two main responsibilities: to work out ideas, and to use cadres well
112
 Such things as drawing up plans, making decisions, and giving orders and directives, are all in the category of "working out ideas"
132
 To put the ideas into practice, we must weld the cadres together and encourage them to go into action; this comes into the category of "using the cadres well"
159
  We must know how to take good care of cadres
46
 There are several ways of doing so
35
   First, give them guidance
28
    Second, raise their level
29
 This means educating them by giving them the  opportunity to study so that they can enhance their theoretical understanding  and their working ability
151
    Third, check up on their work, and help them sum up their experience, carry  forward their achievements and correct their mistakes
134
 To assign work without  checking up and to take notice only when serious mistakes are made--that  is not the way to take care of cadres
136
    Fourth, in general, use the method of persuasion with cadres who have made  mistakes, and help them correct their mistakes
126
 The method of struggle should  be confined to those who make serious mistakes and nevertheless refuse to  accept guidance
122
 Here patience is essential
27
 It is wrong lightly to label  people "opportunists" or lightly to begin "waging struggles" against them
104
    Fifth, help them with their difficulties
44
 When cadres are in difficulty as  a result of illness, straitened means or domestic or other troubles, we must  be sure to give them as much care as possible
158
   This is how to take good care of cadres
42
  A leading group that is genuinely united and linked with the masses can gradually be formed only in the process of mass struggle, and not in isolation from it
160
 In the process of a great struggle, the composition of the leading group in most cases should not and cannot remain entirely unchanged throughout the initial, middle and final stages; the activists who come forward in the course of the struggle must constantly be promoted to replace those original members of the leading group who are inferior by comparison or who have degenerated
383
 All old cadres, therefore, should welcome the new ones with the utmost enthusiasm and show them the warmest solicitude
119
 True, new cadres have their shortcomings
41
 They have not been long in the revolution and lack experience, and unavoidably some have brought with them vestiges of the unwholesome ideology of the old society, remnants of the ideology of petty-bourgeois individualism
222
 But such shortcomings can be gradually eliminated through education and tempering in the revolution
100
 The strong point of the new cadres, as Stalin has said, is that they are acutely sensitive to what is new and are therefore enthusiastic and active to a high degree--the very qualities which some of the old cadres lack
219
 Cadres, new and old, should respect each other, learn from each other and overcome their own shortcomings by learning from each other's strong points, so as to unite as one in the common cause and guard against sectarian tendencies
232
 YOUTH   The world is yours, as well as ours, but in the last analysis, it is yours
83
 You young people, full of vigour and vitality, are in the bloom of life, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning
118
 Our hope is placed on you
26
  The world belongs to you
26
 The establishment of our socialist system has opened the road leading to the ideal society of the future, but to translate this ideal into reality needs hard work
163
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
 That is why we must constantly carry on lively and effective political education among the masses and should always tell them the truth about the difficulties that crop up and discuss with them how to surmount these difficulties
229
  The young people are the most active and vital force in society
65
 They are the most eager to learn and the least conservative in their thinking
78
 This is especially so in the era of socialism
46
 Of course, the young people should learn from the old and other adults, and should strive as much as possible to engage in all sorts of useful activities with their agreement
175
  How should we judge whether a youth is a revolutionary? How can we tell? There can only be one criterion, namely, whether or not he is willing to integrate himself with the broad masses of workers and peasants and does so in practice
235
 If he is willing to do so and actually does so, he is a revolutionary; otherwise he is a non-revolutionary or a counter-revolutionary
134
 If today he integrates himself with the masses of workers and peasants, then today he is a revolutionary; if tomorrow he ceases to do so or turns round to oppress the common people, then he becomes a non-revolutionary or a counter-revolutionary
245
  The intellectuals often tend to be subjective and individualistic, impractical in their thinking and irresolute in action until they have thrown themselves heart and soul into mass revolutionary struggles, or made up their minds to serve the interests of the masses and become one with them
292
 Some will drop out of the revolutionary ranks at critical moments and become passive, while a few may even become enemies of the revolution
140
 The intellectuals can overcome their shortcomings only in mass struggles over a long period
92
 Young people have to study and work, but they are at the age of physical growth
80
 Therefore, full attention must be paid both to their work and study and to their recreation, sport and rest
108
  As for women, in addition to being dominated by these three systems of authority, they are also dominated by the men (the authority of the husband)
149
 How the peasants have overthrown the political authority of the landlords in the countryside has been described above
118
 The political authority of the landlords is the backbone of all the other systems of authority
95
 With that overturned, the clan authority, the religious authority and the authority of the husband all begin to totter
119
  As to the authority of the husband, this has always been weaker among the poor peasants because, out of economic necessity, their womenfolk have to do more manual labour than the women of the richer classes and therefore have more say and greater power of decision in family matters
284
 With the increasing bankruptcy of the rural economy in recent years, the basis for men's domination over women has already been undermined
139
 With the rise of the peasant movement, the women in many places have now begun to organize rural women's associations; the opportunity has come for them to lift up their heads, and the authority of the husband is getting shakier every day
239
 In a word, the whole feudal-patriarchal system and ideology is tottering with the growth of the peasants' power
112
 Unite and take part in production and political activity to improve the economic and political status of women
111
  Protect the interests of the youth, women and children--provide assistance to young students who cannot afford to continue their studies, help the youth and women to organize in order to participate on an equal footing in all work useful to the war effort and to social progress, ensure freedom of marriage and equality as between men and women, and give young people and children a useful education 
402
 [In agricultural production] our fundamental task is to adjust the use of labour power in an organized way and to encourage women to do farm work
146
 In order to build a great socialist society, it is of the utmost importance to arouse the broad masses of women to join in productive activity
143
 Men and women must received equal pay for equal work in production
67
 Genuine equality between the sexes can only be realized in the process of the socialist transformation of society as a whole
125
  With the completion of agricultural co-operation, many co-operatives are finding themselves short of labour
109
 It has become necessary to arouse the great mass of women who did not work in the fields before to take their place on the labour front 
137
 This reserve should be tapped in the struggle to build a great socialist society
81
  Enable every woman who can work to take her place on the labour front, under the principle of equal pay for equal work
120
 This should be done as quickly as possible
43
 CULTURE AND ART   In the world today all culture, all literature and art belong to definite classes and are geared to definite political lines
143
 There is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake, art that stands above classes or art that is detached from or independent of politics
140
 Proletarian literature and art are part of the whole proletarian revolutionary cause; they are, as Lenin said, cogs and wheels in the whole revolutionary machine
162
 Revolutionary culture is a powerful revolutionary weapon for the broad masses of the people
92
 It prepares the ground ideologically before the revolution comes and is an important, indeed essential, fighting front in the general revolutionary front during the revolution
176
  All our literature and art are for the masses of the people, and in the first place for the workers, peasants and soldiers; they are created for the workers, peasants and soldiers and are for their use
203
 Our literary and art workers must accomplish this task and shift their stand; they must gradually move their feet over to the side of the workers, peasants and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat, through the process of going into their very midst and into the thick of practical struggles and through the process of studying Marxism and society
351
 Only in this way can we have a literature and art that are truly for the workers, peasants and soldiers, a truly proletarian literature and art
144
  [Our purpose is] to ensure that literature and art fit well into the whole revolutionary machine as a component part, that they operate as powerful weapons for uniting and educating the people and for attacking and destroying the enemy, and that they help the people fight the enemy with one heart and one mind
312
  In literary and art criticism there are two criteria, the political and the artistic 
87
  There is the political criterion and there is the artistic criterion; what is the relationship between the two? Politics cannot be equated with art, nor can a general world outlook be equated with a method of artistic creation and criticism
242
 We deny not only that there is an abstract and absolutely unchangeable political criterion, but also that there is an abstract and absolutely unchangeable artistic criterion; each class in every class society has its own political and artistic criteria
253
 But all classes in all class societies invariably put the political criterion first and the artistic criterion second
118
  What we demand is the unity of politics and art, the unity of content and form, the unity of revolutionary political content and the highest possible perfection of artistic form
179
 Works of art which lack artistic quality have no force, however progressive they are politically
97
 Therefore, we oppose both the tendency to produce works of art with a wrong political viewpoint and the tendency towards the "poster and slogan style" which is correct in political viewpoint but lacking in artistic power
221
 On questions of literature and art we must carry on a struggle on two fronts
77
 Letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend is the policy for promoting the progress of the arts and sciences and a flourishing socialist culture in our land
189
 Different forms and styles in art should develop freely and different schools in science should contend freely
111
 We think that it is harmful to the growth of art and science if administrative measures are used to impose one particular style of art or school of thought and to ban another
175
 Questions of right and wrong in the arts and science should be settled through free discussion in artistic and scientific circles and through practical work in these fields
173
 They should not be settled in summary fashion
46
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
  An army without culture is a dull-witted army, and a dull-witted army cannot defeat the enemy
95
 So we must be good at learning
31
  Conditions are changing all the time, and to adapt one's thinking to the new conditions, one must study
105
 Even those who have a better grasp of Marxism and are comparatively firm in their proletarian stand have to go on studying, have to absorb what is new and study new problems
174
 We can learn what we did not know
34
 We are not only good at destroying the old world, we are also good at building the new
87
  Now, there are two different attitudes towards learning from others
69
 One is the dogmatic attitude of transplanting everything, whether or not it is suited to our conditions
104
 This is no good
16
 The other attitude is to use our heads and learn those things which suit our conditions, that is, to absorb whatever experience is useful to us
144
 That is the attitude we should adopt
37
  On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
95
  The theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin is universally applicable
72
 We should regard it not as a dogma, but as a guide to action
61
 Studying it is not merely a matter of learning terms and phrases but of learning Marxism-Leninism as the science of revolution
127
 It is not just a matter of understanding the general laws derived by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin from their extensive study of real life and revolutionary experience, but of studying their standpoint and method in examining and solving problems
248
  If we have a correct theory but merely prate about it, pigeonhole it and do not put it into practice, then that theory, however good, is of no significance
157
  It is necessary to master Marxist theory and apply it, master it for the sole purpose of applying it
102
 If you can apply the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint in elucidating one or two practical problems, you should be commended and credited with some achievement
153
 The more problems you elucidate and the more comprehensively and profoundly you do so, the greater will be your achievement
124
 Some comrades, however, are "shooting without a target", shooting at random, and such people are liable to harm the revolution
127
  Those experienced in work must take up the study of theory and must read seriously; only then will they be able to systematize and synthesize their experience and raise it to the level of theory, only then will they not mistake their partial experience for universal truth and not commit empiricist errors
307
  Reading is learning, but applying is also learning and the more important kind of learning at that
100
 Our chief method is to learn warfare through warfare
53
 A person who has had no opportunity to go to school can also learn warfare--he can learn through fighting in war
113
 A revolutionary war is a mass undertaking, it is often n a matter of first learning and then doing, but of doing and the learning, for doing is itself learning
160
  There is a gap between the ordinary civilian and the soldier, but it is no Great Wall, and it can be quickly closed, and the way to close it is to take part in revolution in war
179
 By saying that it is not easy to learn and to apply, we mean that It Is hard to learn thoroughly and to apply skillfully
121
 By saying that civilians can very quickly become soldiers, we mean that it is not difficult to cross the threshold
115
" To cross the threshold is not difficult and mastery, too, is possible provided one sets one's mind to the task and is good at learning
136
  We must learn to do economic work from all who know how, no matter who they are
81
 We must esteem them as teachers, learning from them respectfully and conscientiously
85
 We must not pretend to know when we do not know
48
  Knowledge is a matter of science, and no dishonesty or conceit whatsoever is permissible
90
 What is required is definitely the reverse--honesty and modesty
64
  Complacency is the enemy of study
35
 We cannot really learn anything until we rid ourselves of complacency
70
 Our attitude towards ourselves should be "to be insatiable in learning" and towards others "to be tireless in teaching"
120
  Some people have read a few Marxist books and think themselves quite learned, but what they have read has not penetrated, has not struck root in their minds, so that they do not know how to use it and their class feelings remain as of old
240
 Others are very conceited and having learned some book-phrases, they think themselves terrific and are very cocky; but whenever a storm blows up, they take a stand very different from that of the workers and the great majority of the peasants
243
 They waver while the latter stand firm, they equivocate while the latter are forthright
88
 In order to have a real grasp of Marxism, one must learn it not only from books, but chiefly through class struggle, through practical work and close contact with the masses of workers and peasants
198
 When in addition to reading some Marxist books our intellectuals have gained some understanding through close contact with the masses of workers and peasants and through their own practical work, we will all be speaking the same language, not only the common language of patriotism and the common language of the socialist system, but probably even the common language of the communist world outlook
400
 If that happens, all of us will certainly work much better
59
 Every Communist must grasp the truth, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun
88
 The seizure of power by armed force, the settlement of the issue by war, is the central task and the highest form of revolution
128
 According to the Marxist theory of the state, the army is the chief component of state power
93
 Whoever wants to seize and retain state power must have a strong army
70
 Some people ridicule us as advocates of the "omnipotence of war"
65
 Yes, we are advocates of the omnipotence of revolutionary war; that is good, not bad, it is Marxist
100
 We shall create a democratic republic
38
 Experience in the class struggle in the era of imperialism teaches us that it is only by the power of the gun that the working class and the labouring masses can defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords; in this sense we may say that only with guns can the whole world be transformed
286
  The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism
64
 If there is to be revolution, there must be a revolutionary party
66
 Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and in the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary style, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs
268
 Without this core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious
63
 These are two cardinal principles
34
 If we doubt these principles, we shall accomplish nothing
58
 On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation (July 31, 1955), 3rd ed
69
 No political party can possibly lead a great revolutionary movement to victory unless it possesses revolutionary theory and a knowledge of history and has a profound grasp of the practical movement
198
 As we used to say, the rectification movement is "a widespread movement of Marxist education"
94
 We can certainly learn more Marxism in the course of the rectification movement
80
 Policy is the starting-point of all the practical actions of a revolutionary party and manifests itself in the process and the end-result of that party's actions
162
 A revolutionary party is carrying out a policy whenever it takes any action
76
 If it is not carrying out a correct policy, it is carrying out a wrong policy; if it is not carrying out a given policy consciously, it is doing so blindly
156
 What we call experience is the process and the end-result of carrying out a policy
83
 Only through the practice of the people, that is, through experience, can we verify whether a policy is correct or wrong and determine to what extent it is correct or wrong
173
 But people's practice, especially the practice of a revolutionary party and the revolutionary masses, cannot but be related to one policy or another
149
 Classes struggle, some classes triumph, others are eliminated
62
 Such is history, such is the history of civilization for thousands of years
76
 To interpret history from this viewpoint is historical materialism; standing in opposition to this viewpoint is historical idealism
132
 In class society everyone lives as a member of a particular class, and every kind of thinking, without exception, is stamped with the brand of a class
151
 Changes in society are due chiefly to the development of the internal contradictions in society, that is, the contradiction between the productive forces and the relations of production, the contradiction between classes and the contradiction between the old and the new; it is the development of these contradictions that pushes society forward and gives the impetus for the supersession of the old society by the new
419
 The ruthless economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasants by the landlord class forced them into numerous uprisings against its rule 
152
 In the final analysis, national struggle is a matter of class struggle
71
 Among the whites in the United States it is only the reactionary ruling circles who oppress the black people
109
 They can in no way represent the workers, farmers, revolutionary intellectuals and other enlightened persons who comprise the overwhelming majority of the white people
168
 It is up to us to organize the people
38
 Everything reactionary is the same; if you don't hit it, it won't fall
71
 It is like sweeping the floor; where the broom does not reach, the dust never vanishes of itself
97
 The enemy will not perish of himself
37
 A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous
209
 A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another
90
 And we? Our policy is to give him tit for tat and to fight for every inch of land
82
 We act after his fashion
25
 He always tries to impose war on the people, one sword in his left hand and another in his right
97
 We take up swords, too, following his example
46
 Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of the first importance for the revolution
104
 A revolutionary party is the guide of the masses, and no revolution ever succeeds when the revolutionary party leads them astray
129
 To ensure that we will definitely achieve success in our revolution and will not lead the masses astray, we must pay attention to uniting with our real friends in order to attack our real enemies
196
 Our enemies are all those in league with imperialism--the warlords, the bureaucrats, the comprador class, the big landlord class and the reactionary section of the intelligentsia attached to them
196
 The leading force in our revolution is the industrial proletariat
66
 Our closest friends are the entire semi-proletariat and petty bourgeoisie
74
 As for the vacillating middle bourgeoisie, their right-wing may become our enemy and their left-wing may become our friend--but we must be constantly on our guard and not let them create confusion within our ranks
214
 Whoever sides with the revolutionary people is a revolutionary
63
 Whoever sides with imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism is a counter-revolutionary
95
 Whoever sides with the revolutionary people in words only but acts otherwise is a revolutionary in speech
106
 Whoever sides with the revolutionary people in deed as well as in word is a revolutionary in the full sense
108
 I hold that it is bad as far as we are concerned if a person, a political party, an army or a school is not attacked by the enemy, for in that case it would definitely mean that we have sunk to the level of the enemy
217
 It is good if we are attacked by the enemy, since it proves that we have drawn a clear line of demarcation between the enemy and ourselves
139
 It is still better if the enemy attacks us wildly and paints us as utterly black and without a single virtue; it demonstrates that we have not only drawn a clear line of demarcation between the enemy and ourselves but achieved a great deal in our work
252
 To Be Attacked by the Enemy Is Not a Bad Thing but a Good Thing (May 26, 1939), 1st pocket ed
94
 We should support whatever the enemy opposes and oppose whatever the enemy supports
84
 Our stand is that of the proletariat and of the masses
55
 After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, there will still be enemies without guns; they are bound to struggle desperately against us; we must never regard these enemies lightly
185
 If we do not now raise and understand the problem in this way, we shall commit very grave mistakes
99
 The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will certainly not take their defeat lying down and they will struggle to the last ditch
133
 After there is peace and order throughout the country, they will still engage in sabotage and create disturbances in various ways and will try every day and every minute to stage a come-back
191
 This is inevitable and beyond all doubt, and under no circumstances must we relax our vigilance
96
 The class struggle is by no means over
39
 The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between the different political forces, and the class struggle in the ideological field between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie will continue to be long and tortuous and at times even become very acute
289
 The proletariat seeks to transform the world according to its own world outlook, and so does the bourgeoisie
109
 In this respect, the question of which will win out, socialism or capitalism, is not really settled
100
 On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
94
 It will take a fairly long period of time to decide the issue in the ideological struggle between socialism and capitalism in our country
138
 The reason is that the influence of the bourgeoisie and of the intellectuals who come from the old society will remain in our country for a long time to come, the so will their class ideology 
193
 If this is not sufficiently understood, or is not understood at all, the gravest mistakes will be made and the necessity of waging struggle in the ideological field will be ignored
181
 In our country bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology, anti-Marxist ideology, will continue to exist for a long time
117
 Basically, the socialist system has been established in our country
68
 We have won the basic victory in transforming the ownership of the means of production, but we have not yet won complete victory on the political and ideological fronts
169
 In the ideological field, the question of who will win in the struggle between the proletariat or the bourgeoisie has not been really settled yet
146
 We still have to wage a protracted struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology
91
 It is wrong not to understand this and to give up ideological struggle
71
 All erroneous ideas, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters, must be subjected to criticism; in no circumstances should they be allowed to spread unchecked
162
 However, the criticism should be fully reasoned, analytical and convincing, and not rough, bureaucratic, metaphysical or dogmatic
130
 Both dogmatism and revisionism run counter to Marxism
54
 Marxism must certainly advance; it must develop along with practice and cannot stand still
91
 It would become lifeless if it remained stagnant and stereotyped
65
 However, the basic principles of Marxism must never be violated, otherwise mistakes will be made
97
 It is dogmatism to approach Marxism from a metaphysical point of view and to regard it as something rigid
106
 It is revisionism to negate the basic principles of Marxism and to negate its universal truth
94
 Revisionism is one form of bourgeois ideology
46
 The revisionists deny the differences between socialism and capitalism, between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie
156
 What they advocate is in fact not the socialist line but the capitalist line
77
 One of our current important tasks on the ideological front is to unfold criticism of revisionism
98
 Revisionism, or Right opportunism, is a bourgeois trend of thought that is even more dangerous than dogmatism
110
 The revisionists, the Right opportunists, pay lip-service to Marxism; they too attack "dogmatism"
98
 But what they are really attacking is the quintessence of Marxism
66
 After the basic victory of the socialist revolution in our country, there are still a number of people who vainly hope to restore the capitalist system and fight the working class on every front, including the ideological one
226
 And their right-hand men in this struggle are the revisionists
63
 On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
94
 Communism is at once a complete system of proletarian ideology and a new social system
87
 It is different from any other ideology or social system, and is the most complete, progressive, revolutionary and rational system in human history
148
 The ideological and social system of feudalism has a place only in the museum of history
89
 The ideological and social system of capitalism has also become a museum piece in one part of the world (in the Soviet Union), while in other countries it resembles "a dying person who is sinking fast, like the sun setting beyond the western hills", and will soon be relegated to the museum
291
 The communist ideological and social system alone is full of youth and vitality, sweeping the world with the momentum of an avalanche and the force of a thunderbolt
165
 360-361
8
 The socialist system will eventually replace the capitalist system; this is an objective law independent of man's will
119
 However much the reactionaries try to hold back the wheel of history, sooner or later revolution will take place and will inevitably triumph
141
 in Celebration of the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution" (November 6, 1957)
101
 We Communists never conceal our political views
48
 The democratic revolution is the necessary preparation for the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution is the inevitable sequel to the democratic revolution
168
 The ultimate aim for which all communists strive is to bring about a socialist and communist society
101
 Socialist revolution aims at liberating the productive forces
62
 The change-over from individual to socialist, collective ownership in agricultural and handicrafts and from capitalist to socialist ownership in private industry and commerce is bound to bring about a tremendous liberation of the productive forces
248
 Thus the social conditions are being created for a tremendous expansion of industrial and agricultural production
114
 We are now carrying out a revolution not only in the social system, the change from private to public ownership, but also in technology, the change from handicraft to large-scale modern machine production, and the two revolutions are interconnected
249
 In agriculture, with conditions as they are in our country, co-operation must precede the use of big machinery (in capitalist countries agriculture develops in a capitalist way)
178
 Therefore we must on no account regard industry and agriculture, socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture as two separate and isolated things, and on no account must we emphasize the one and play down the other
246
 On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation (July 31, 1955), 3rd ed
69
 The new social system has only just been established and requires time for its consolidation
93
 It must not be assumed that the new system can be completely consolidated the moment it is established, for that is impossible
127
 It has to be consolidated step by step
39
 To achieve its ultimate consolidation, it is necessary not only to bring about the socialist industrialization of the country and persevere in the socialist revolution on the economic front, but also to carry on constant and arduous socialist revolutionary struggles and socialist education on the political and ideological fronts
331
 Moreover, various complementary international conditions are required
70
 But we should all realize that the new system of socialism will unquestionably be consolidated
95
 We can assuredly build a socialist state with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture
114
 The number of intellectuals who are hostile to our state is very small
71
 They do not like our state, ie the dictatorship of the proletariat, and yearn for the old society
98
 As between the proletarian and the bourgeois roads, as between the socialist and the capitalist roads, they stubbornly choose to follow the latter
147
 In fact this road is impossible, and in fact, therefore, they are ready to capitulate to imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism
138
 Such persons are found in political circles and in industrial and commercial, cultural and educational, scientific and technological and religious circles, and they are extremely reactionary
191
 The serious problem is the education of the peasantry
54
 The peasant economy is scattered, and the socialization of agriculture, judging by the Soviet Union's experience, will require a long time and painstaking work
160
 Without socialization of agriculture, there can be no complete, consolidated socialism
87
 These two points are the essence of the matter, the main current
65
 On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation (July 31, 1955), 3rd ed
69
 The leading bodies in co-operatives must establish the dominant position of the poor peasants and the new lower middle peasants in these bodies, with the old lower middle peasants and the upper middle peasants--whether old or new--as the supplementary force
258
 Otherwise, unity between the middle and poor peasants cannot be attained, the co-operatives cannot be consolidated, production cannot be expanded and the socialist transformation of the entire countryside cannot be achieved
224
 It is essential to unite with the middle peasants, and it is wrong not to do so
80
 That was the case when the struggle against the landlords was being waged and the land reform was being carried out, and that is the case today when the struggle against the rich peasants and other capitalist elements is being waged to achieve the socialist transformation of agriculture
288
 In both these revolutionary periods, the middle peasants wavered in the initial stages
87
 It is only after they clearly see the general trend of events and the approaching triumph of the revolution that the middle peasants will come in on the side of the revolution
176
 The poor peasants must work on the middle peasants and win them over, so that the revolution will broaden from clay to day until final victory
143
 There is a serious tendency towards capitalism among the well-to-do peasants
77
 This tendency will become rampant if we in the slightest way neglect political work among the peasants during the co-operative movement and for a very long period after
169
 The agricultural co-operative movement has been a severe ideological and political struggle from the very beginning
116
 No cooperative can be established without going through such a struggle
72
 Before a brand-new social system can be built on the site of the old the site must be swept clean
98
 Invariably, remnants of old ideas reflecting the old system remain in people's minds for a long time, and they do not easily give way
134
 After a co-operative is established, it must go through many more struggles before it can be consolidated
106
 Even then, the moment it relaxes its efforts it may collapse
61
 The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants
216
 On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land
173
 If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day
110
 Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties
174
 Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road
201
 Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand firm in these circumstances? Obviously not
93
 There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis
59
 And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together
471
 We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance

 On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
94
 More people mean a greater ferment of ideas, more enthusiasm and more energy
77
 Never before have the masses of the people been so inspired, so militant and so daring as at present
101
 This may seem a bad thing, but in reality it is a good thing
61
 Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, the desire for action and the desire for revolution
97
 On a blank sheet of paper free from any mark, the freshest and most beautiful characters can be written, the freshest and most beautiful pictures can be painted
161
 The first is internal that is, the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie
95
 Consequently, after the victory of the people's democratic revolution, the state power of the people's republic under the leadership of the working class must not be weakened but must be strengthened
200
 "Don't you want to abolish state power?" Yes, we do, but not right now; we cannot do it yet
92
 Why? Because imperialism still exists, because domestic reaction still exists, because classes still exist in our country
122
 Our present task is to strengthen the people's state apparatus--mainly the people's army, the people's police and the people's courts--in order to consolidate national defence and protect the people's interests
211
 Our state is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance
114
 What is this dictatorship for? Its first function is to suppress the reactionary classes and elements and those exploiters in our country who resist the socialist revolution, to suppress those who try to wreck our socialist construction, or in other words, to resolve the internal contradictions between ourselves and the enemy
328
 For instance, to arrest, try and sentence certain counter-revolutionaries, and to deprive landlords and bureaucrat-capitalists of their right to vote and their freedom of speech for a specified period of time--all this comes within the scope of our dictatorship
262
 To maintain public order and safeguard the interests of the people, it is likewise necessary to exercise dictatorship over embezzlers, swindlers, arsonists, murderers, criminal gangs and other scoundrels who seriously disrupt public order
239
 The second function of this dictatorship is to protect our country from subversion and possible aggression by external enemies
127
 In that event, it is the task of this dictatorship to resolve the external contradiction between ourselves and the enemy
121
 On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
94
 The people's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class
79
 For it is only the working class that is most far-sighted, most selfless and most thoroughly revolutionary
107
 The entire history of revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class revolution fails and that with the leadership of the working class revolution triumphs
176
 These two classes are the main force in overthrowing imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries
98
 The transition from New Democracy to socialism also depends mainly upon their alliance
87
 Class struggle, the struggle for production and scientific experiment are the three great revolutionary movements for building a mighty socialist country
154
 These movements are a sure guarantee that Communists will be free from bureaucracy and immune against revisionism and dogmatism, and will for ever remain invincible
165
 They are a reliable guarantee that the proletariat will be able to unite with the broad working masses and realize a democratic dictatorship
141
 Note on "The Seven Well-Written Documents of Chekiang Province Concerning Cadres' Participation in Physical Labour" (May 9, 1963), quoted in On Khrushchov's Phoney Communism and Its Historical Lessons f or the World
216
 The people's democratic dictatorship uses two methods
54
 Towards the enemy, it uses the method of dictatorship, that is, for as long a period of time as is necessary it does not let them take part in political activities and compels them to obey the law of the People's Government and to engage in labour and, through labour, transform themselves into new men
303
 Towards the people, on the contrary, it uses the method not of compulsion but of democracy, that is, it must necessarily let them take part in political activities and does not compel them to do this or that, but uses the method of democracy in educating and persuading them
275
 This is a socialist movement for the self-education and self-remoulding of the people
86
 in Celebration of the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution" (November 6, 1957)
101
 Most arduous tasks lie ahead of us in the great work of construction
69
 We are confronted with two types of social contradictions -- those between ourselves and the enemy and those among the people themselves
137
 The two are totally different in their nature
46
 On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
94
 To understand these two different types of contradictions correctly, we must first be clear on what is meant by "the people" and what is meant by "the enemy"
158
  At the present stage, the period of building socialism, the classes, strata and social groups which favour, support and work for the cause of socialist construction all come within the category of the people, while the social forces and groups which resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to or sabotage socialist construction are all enemies of the people
367
 Our People's Government is one that genuinely represents the people's interests, it is a government that serves the people
123
 Nevertheless, there are still certain contradictions between this government and the people
92
 These include the contradictions between the interests of the state and the interests of the collective and the interests of the individual; between democracy and centralism; between the leadership and the led; and the contradictions arising from the bureaucratic style of work of certain government workers in their relations with the masses
343
 All these are also contradictions among the people
51
 Generally speaking, the people's basic identity of interests underlies the contradictions among the people
107
 The contradictions between ourselves and the enemy are antagonistic contradictions
83
 Within the ranks of the people, the contradictions among the working people are non-antagonistic, while those between the exploited and the exploiting classes have a non-antagonistic in addition to an antagonistic aspect
221
 In the political life of our people, how should right be distinguised from wrong in one's words and actions? On the basis of the principles of our Constitution, the will of the overwhelming majority of our people and the common political positions which have been proclaimed on various occasions by our political parties and groups, we consider that, broadly speaking, the criteria should be as follows:   (1) Words and deeds should help to unite, and not divide, the people of all  our nationalities
501
    (2) They should be beneficial, and not harmful, to socialist transformation  and socialist construction
107
    (3) They should help to consolidate, and not undermine or weaken, the people's  democratic dictatorship
107
    (4) They should help to consolidate, and not undermine or weaken, democratic  centralism
92
    (6) They should be beneficial, and not harmful, to international socialist  unity and the unity of the peace-loving people of the world
139
  (2) They should be beneficial, and not harmful, to socialist transformation  and socialist construction
105
  (3) They should help to consolidate, and not undermine or weaken, the people's  democratic dictatorship
105
  (4) They should help to consolidate, and not undermine or weaken, democratic  centralism
90
  (6) They should be beneficial, and not harmful, to international socialist  unity and the unity of the peace-loving people of the world
137
 The question of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is one of a struggle between ourselves and the enemy, a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy
154
 Among the people, there are some who see this question in a somewhat different light
85
 Two kinds of people hold views differing from ours
51
 Those with a Rightist way of thinking make no distinction between ourselves and the enemy and take the enemy for our own people
128
 They regard as friends the very persons whom the masses regard as enemies
74
 Those with a "Left" deviation in their thinking magnify contradictions between ourselves and the enemy to such an extent that they take certain contradictions among the people for contradictions with the enemy and regard as counter-revolutionaries persons who are actually not counter-revolutionaries
301
 Both these views are wrong
27
 Neither can lead to the correctly handling of the problem of suppressing counter-revolutionaries or to a correct assessment of this work
137
 Qualitatively different contradictions can only be resolved by qualitatively different methods
95
  The principle of using different methods to resolve different contradictions is one which Marxist-Leninists must strictly observe
131
 Since they are different in nature, the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and the contradictions among the people must be resolved by different methods
165
 To put it briefly, the former entail drawing a clear distinction between ourselves and the enemy, and the latter entail drawing a clear distinction between right and wrong
172
 It is, of course, true that the distinction between ourselves and the enemy is also one of right and wrong
107
 For example, the question of who is in the right, we or the domestic and foreign reactionaries, the imperialists, the feudalists and bureaucrat-capitalists, is also a matter of right and wrong, but it is in a different category from questions of right and wrong among the people
279
 On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
94
 The only way to settle questions of an ideological nature or controversial issues among the people is by the democratic method, the method of discussion, criticism, persuasion and education, and not by the method of coercion or repression
239
 To be able to carry on their production and studies effectively and to arrange their lives properly, the people want their government and those in charge of production and of cultural and educational organizations to issue appropriate orders of an obligatory nature
266
 It is common sense that the maintenance of public order would be impossible without such adminstrative regulations
115
 Administrative orders and the method of persuasion and education complement each other in resolving contradictions among the people
132
 Even administrative regulations for the maintenance of public order must be accompanied by persuasion and education, for in many cases regulations alone will not work
167
 Inevitably, the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie will give expression to their own ideologies
95
 Inevitably, they will stubbornly express themselves on political and ideological questions by every possible means
115
 You cannot expect them to do otherwise
39
 We should not use the method of suppression and prevent them from expressing themselves, but should allow them to do so and at the same time argue with them and direct appropriate criticism at them
198
 We must undoubtedly criticize wrong ideas of every description
63
 It certainly would not be right to refrain from criticism, look on while wrong ideas spread unchecked and allow them to monopolize the field
141
 Mistakes must be criticized and poisonous weeds fought wherever they crop up
77
 However, such criticism should not be dogmatic, and the metaphysical method should not be used, but instead the effort should be made to apply the dialectical method
166
 What is needed is scientific analysis and convincing argument
62
 To criticize the people's shortcomings is necessary, but in doing so we must truly take the stand of the people and speak out of whole-hearted eagerness to protect and educate them
181
 To treat comrades like enemies is to go over to the stand of the enemy
71
 Contradiction and struggle are universal and absolute, but the methods of resolving contradictions, that is, the forms of struggle, differ according to the differences in the nature of the contradictions
204
 Some contradictions are characterized by open antagonism, others are not
73
 In accordance with the concrete development of things, some contradictions which were originally non-antagonistic develop into antagonistic ones, while others which were originally antagonistic develop into non-antagonistic ones
229
 In ordinary circumstances, contradictions among the people are not antagonistic
80
 But if they are not handled properly, or if we relax our vigilance and lower our guard, antagonism may arise
109
 In a socialist country, a development of this kind is usually only a localized and temporary phenomenon
104
 The reason is that the system of exploitation of man by man has been abolished and the interests of the people are basically the same
134
 On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
94
 In our country, the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie belongs to the category of contradictions among the people
148
 In the period of the bourgeois-democratic revolution, it had both a revolutionary and a conciliationist side to its character
126
 In the period of the socialist revolution, exploitation of the working class for profit constitutes one side of the character of the national bourgeoisie, while its support of the Constitution and its willingness to accept socialist transformation constitute the other
269
 The national bourgeoisie differs from the imperialists, the landlords and the bureaucrat-capitalists
101
 The contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class is one between exploiter and exploited, and is by nature antagonistic
143
 However, it will change into a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy if we do not handle it properly and do not follow the policy of uniting with, criticizing and educating the national bourgeoisie, or if the national bourgeoisie does not accept this policy of ours
274
 It [the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary in 1956] was a case of reactionaries inside a socialist country, in league with the imperialists, attempting to achieve their conspiratorial aims by taking advantage of contradictions among the people to foment dissension and stir up disorder
294
 The lesson of the Hungarian incident merits attention
54
 War is the highest form of struggle for resolving contradictions, when they have developed to a certain stage, between classes, nations, states, or political groups, and it has existed ever since the emergence of private property and of classes
245
 Unless you understand the actual circumstances of war, its nature and its relations to other things, you will not know the laws of war, or know how to direct war, or be able to win victory
189
 "War is the continuation of politics
37
" In this sense war is politics and war itself is a political action; since ancient times there has never been a war that did not have a political character 
157
 But war has its own particular characteristics and in this sense it cannot be equated with politics in general
111
 "War is the continuation of politics by other means
52
" When politics develops to a certain stage beyond which it cannot proceed by the usual means, war breaks out to sweep the obstacles from the way 
146
 When the obstacle is removed and our political aim attained, the war will stop
79
 But if the obstacle is not completely swept away, the war will have to continue till the aim is fully accomplished 
116
 It can therefore be said that politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed
101
 History shows that wars are divided into two kinds, just and unjust
68
 All wars that are progressive are just, and all wars that impede progress are unjust
85
 We Communists oppose all unjust wars that impede progress, but we do not oppose progressive, just wars
103
 Not only do we Communists not oppose just wars, we actively participate in them
80
 As for unjust wars, World War I is an instance in which both sides fought for imperialist interests; therefore the Communists of the whole world firmly opposed that war
169
 The way to oppose a war of this kind is to do everything possible to prevent it before it breaks out and, once it breaks out, to oppose war with war, to oppose unjust war with just war, whenever possible
204
 Revolutions and revolutionary wars are inevitable in class society and that without them, it is impossible to accomplish any leap in social development and to overthrow the reactionary ruling classes and therefore impossible for the people to win political power
263
 Revolutionary war is an antitoxin which not only eliminates the enemy's poison but also purges us of our own filth
115
 Every just, revolutionary war is endowed with tremendous power, which can transform many things or clear the way for their transformation
138
 Every Communist must grasp the truth, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun
88
 The seizure of power by armed force, the settlement of the issue by war, is the central task and the highest form of revolution
128
 According to the Marxist theory of the state, the army is the chief component of state power
93
 Whoever wants to seize and retain state power must have a strong army
70
 Some people ridicule us as advocates of the "omnipotence of war"
65
 Yes, we are advocates of the omnipotence of revolutionary war; that is good, not bad, it is Marxist
100
 We shall create a democratic republic
38
 Experience in the class struggle in the era of imperialism teaches us that it is only by the power of the gun that the working class and the labouring masses can defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords; in this sense we may say that only with guns can the whole world be transformed
286
 We are advocates of the abolition of war, we do not want war; but war can only be abolished through war, and in order to get rid of the gun it is necessary to take up the gun
175
 War, this monster of mutual slaughter among men, will be finally eliminated by the progress of human society, and in the not too distant future too
148
 But there is only one way to eliminate it and that is to oppose war with war, to oppose counter-revolutionary war with revolutionary war, to oppose national counter-revolutionary war with national revolutionary war, and to oppose counter-revolutionary class war with revolutionary class war 
292
 When human society advances to the point where classes and states are eliminated, there will be no more wars, counter-revolutionary or revolutionary, unjust or just; that will be the era of perpetual peace for mankind
218
 Our study of the laws of revolutionary war springs from the desire to eliminate all wars; herein lies the distinction between us Communists and all the exploiting classes
171
 Our country and all the other socialist countries want peace; so do the peoples of all the countries of the world
114
 The only ones who crave war and do not want peace are certain monopoly capitalist groups in a handful of imperialist countries which depend on aggression for their profits
172
 To achieve a lasting world peace, we must further develop our friendship and co-operation with the fraternal countries in the socialist camp and strengthen our solidarity with all peace-loving countries
203
 We must endeavour to establish normal diplomatic relations, on the basis of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty and of equality and mutual benefit, with all countries willing to live together with us in peace
230
 We must give active support to the national independence and liberation movement in countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America as well as to the peace movement and to just struggles in all the countries of the world
217
 As for the imperialist countries, we should unite with their people and strive to coexist peacefully with those countries, do business with them and prevent any possible war, but under no circumstances should we harbour any unrealistic notions about them
255
 On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
94
 We desire peace
16
 However, if imperialism insists on fighting a war, we will have no alternative but to take the firm resolution to fight to the finish before going ahead with our construction
175
 If you are afraid of war day in day out, what will you do if war eventually comes? First I said that the East Wind is prevailing over the West Wind and war will not break out, and now I have added these explanations about the situation in case war should break out
265
 Both possibilities have thus been taken into account
53
 People all over the world are now discussing whether or not a third world war will break out
93
 On this question, too, we must be mentally prepared and do some analysis
73
 We stand firmly for peace and against war
42
 But if the imperialists insist on unleashing another war, we should not be afraid of it
88
 Our attitude on this question is the same as our attitude towards any disturbance: first, we are against it; second, we are not afraid of it
141
 The First World War was followed by the birth of the Soviet Union with a population of 200 million
99
 The Second World War was followed by the emergence of the socialist camp with a combined population of 900 million
115
 If the imperialists insist on launching a third world war, it is certain that several hundred million more will turn to socialism, and then there will not be much room left on earth for the imperialists; it is also likely that the whole structure of imperialism will utterly collapse
284
 On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
94
 Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again till their doom; that is the logic of the imperialists and all reactionaries the world over in dealing with the people's cause, and they will never go against this logic
221
 This is a Marxist law
22
 When we say "imperialism is ferocious", we mean that its nature will never change, that the imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives, that they will never become Buddhas, till their doom
200
 Fight, fail, fight again, fail again, fight again till their victory; that is the logic of the people, and they too will never go against this logic
149
 This is another Marxist law
28
 Just because we have won victory, we must never relax our vigilance against the frenzied plots for revenge by the imperialists and their running dogs
150
 Whoever relaxes vigilance will disarm himself politically and land himself in a passive position
97
 That is certain; they will never neglect these activities
58
 They will do this as long as it is possible
44
 All this we must take fully into account
41
 The world is progressing, the future is bright and no one can change this general trend of history
99
 We should carry on constant propaganda among the people on the facts of world progress and the bright future ahead so that they will build their confidence in victory
167
 All reactionaries are paper tigers
35
 In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality they are not so powerful
89
 From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful
99
 Just as there is not a single thing in the world without a dual nature (this is the law of the unity of opposites), so imperialism and all reactionaries have a dual nature -- they are real tigers and paper tigers at the same time
230
 In past history, before they won state power and for some time afterwards, the slave-owning class, the feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie were vigorous, revolutionary and progressive; they were real tigers
213
 But with the lapse of time, because their opposites -- the slave class, the peasant class and the proletariat -- grew in strength step by step, struggled against them and became more and more formidable, these ruling classes changed step by step into the reverse, changed into reactionaries, changed into backward people, changed into paper tigers
348
 And eventually they were overthrown, or will be overthrown, by the people
74
 The reactionary, backward, decaying classes retained this dual nature even in their last life-and-death struggles against the people
133
 On the one hand, they were real tigers; they ate people, ate people by the millions and tens of millions
105
 The cause of the people's struggle went through a period of difficulties and hardships, and along the path there were many twists and turns
140
 Look! Were these not living tigers, iron tigers, real tigers? But in the end they changed into paper tigers, dead tigers, bean-curd tigers
139
 These are historical facts
27
 Have people not seen or heard about these facts? There have indeed been thousands and tens of thousands of them! Thousands and tens of thousands! Hence, imperialism and all reactionaries, looked at in essence, from a long-term point of view, from a strategic point of view, must be seen for what they are -- paper tigers
321
 On this we should build our strategic thinking
47
 On the other hand, they are also living tigers, iron tigers, real tigers which can eat people
94
 On this we should build our tactical thinking
46
 I have said that all allegedly powerful reactionaries are merely paper tigers
78
 The reason is that they are divorced from the people
53
 As we know, they were all overthrown
37
 US imperialism has not yet been overthrown and it has the atom bomb
68
 I believe it too will be overthrown
36
 It, too, is a paper tiger
26
 The reactionaries in all countries are fools of this kind
58
 In the final analysis, their persecution of the revolutionary people only serves to accelerate the people's revolutions on a broader and more intense scale
156
 in Celebration of the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution" (November 6, 1957)
101
 A short while ago it sent its armed forces to invade and occupy Lebanon
72
 The United States has set up hundreds of military bases in many countries all over the world
93
 The longer the US aggressors remain in those places, the tighter the nooses round their necks will become
106
 Imperialism will not last long because it always does evil things
66
 It persists in grooming and supporting reactionaries in all countries who are against the people, it has forcibly seized many colonies and semi-colonies and many military bases, and it threatens the peace with atomic war
221
 Thus, forced by imperialism to do so, more than 90 per cent of the people of the world are rising or will rise up in struggle against it
137
 Yet imperialism is still alive, still running amuck in Asia, Africa and Latin America
86
 In the West imperialism is still oppressing the people at home
63
 This situation must change
27
 It is the task of the people of the whole world to put an end to the aggression and oppression perpetrated by imperialism, and chiefly by US imperialism
153
 Interview with a Hsinhua News Agency correspondent (September 29, 1958)
72
 Riding roughshod everywhere, US imperialism has made itself the enemy of the people of the world and has increasingly isolated itself
134
 Those who refuse to be enslaved will never be cowed by the atom bombs and hydrogen bombs in the hands of the US imperialists
125
 The raging tide of the people of the world against tile US aggressors is irresistible
86
 If the US monopoly capitalist groups persist in pushing their policies of aggression and war, the day is bound to come when they will be hanged by the people of the whole world
177
 The same fate awaits the accomplices of the United States
58
 Over a long period we have developed this concept for the struggle against the enemy: strategically we should despise all our enemies, but tactically we should take them all seriously
184
 This also means that we must despise the enemy with respect to the whole, but that we must take him seriously with respect to each and every concrete question
159
 If we do not despise the enemy with respect to the whole, we shall be committing the error of opportunism
106
 Marx and Engels were only two individuals, and yet in those early days they already declared that capitalism would be overthrown throughout the world
150
 But in dealing with concrete problems and particular enemies we shall be committing the error of adventurism unless we take them seriously

 In war, battles can only be fought one by one and the enemy forces can only be destroyed one by one
100
 Factories can only be built one by one
39
 The peasants can only plough the land plot by plot
51
 The same is even true of eating a meal
39
 Strategically, we take the eating of a meal lightly&#151;we know we can finish it
82
 But actually we eat it mouthful by mouthful
44
 It is impossible to swallow an entire banquet in one gulp
58
 This is known as a piecemeal solution
38
 In military parlance, it is called wiping out the enemy forces one by one
74
 It is my opinion that the international situation has now reached a new turning point
86
 There are two winds in the world today, the East Wind and the West Wind
72
" I believe it is characteristic of the situation today that the East Wind is prevailing over the West Wind
107
 That is to say, the forces of socialism have become overwhelmingly superior to the forces of imperialism
105
 People of the world, unite and defeat the US aggressors and all their running dogs! People of the world, be courageous, dare to fight, defy difficulties and advance wave upon wave
180
 Then the whole world will belong to the people

 Historically, all reactionary forces on the verge of extinction invariably conduct a last desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces, and some revolutionaries are apt to be deluded for a time by this phenomenon of outward strength but inner weakness, failing to grasp the essential fact that the enemy is nearing extinction while they themselves are approaching victory
379
 If they [the Kuomintang] fight, we will wipe them out completely
65
 This is the way things are: if they attack and we wipe them out, they will have that satisfaction; wipe out some, some satisfaction; wipe out more, more satisfaction; wipe out the whole lot, complete satisfaction
213
 If they start fighting, we fight back, fight to win peace
58
 If anyone attacks us and if the conditions are favourable for battle we will certainly act in self-defence to wipe him out resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and completely (we do not strike rashly, but when we do strike, we must win)
231
 We must never be cowed by the bluster of reactionaries
55
 As far as our own desire is concerned, we don't want to fight even for a single day
84
 But if circumstances force us to fight, we can fight to the finish
67
 We are for peace
17
 Not that we are warlike
24
 We are willing to stop the war at once and leave the remaining questions for later settlement
94
 But US imperialism is not willing to do so
43
 All right then, let the fighting go on
39
 We should rid our ranks of all impotent thinking
49
 All views that overestimate the strength of the enemy and underestimate the strength of the people are wrong
109
 The oppressed peoples and nations must not pin their hopes for liberation on the "sensibleness" of imperialism and its lackeys
127
 They will only triumph by strengthening their unity and persevering in their struggle

 No matter when this country-wide civil war breaks out, we must be well prepared
80
 If it comes early, say, tomorrow morning, we should also be prepared
69
 That is point one
18
 In the present international and domestic situation it is possible that for a time the civil war may be kept restricted in scale and localized
143
 That is point two
18
 Point one is what we should prepare for point two is what has existed for a long time
86
 In short, we must be prepared
30
 Being prepared, we shall be able to deal properly with all kinds of complicated situations
91
 The revolutionary war is a war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them
112
 What is a true bastion of iron? It is the masses, the millions upon millions of people who genuinely and sincerely support the revolution
138
 That is the real iron bastion which no force can smash, no force whatsoever
76
 The counter-revolution cannot smash us; on the contrary, we shall smash it
75
 The richest source of power to wage war lies in the masses of the people
73
 The imperialists are bullying us in such a way that we will have to deal with them seriously
93
 Not only must we have a powerful regular army, we must also organize contingents of the people's militia on a big scale
120
 This will make it difficult for the imperialists to move a single inch in our country in the event of invasion
111
 Interview with a Hsinhua News Agency correspondent (September 29, 1958)
72
 Considering the revolutionary war as a whole, the operations of the people's guerrillas and those of the main forces of the Red Army complement each other like a man's right arm and left arm, and if we had only the main forces of the Red Army without the people's guerrillas, we would be like a warrior with only one arm
321
 In concrete terms, and especially with regard to military operations, when we talk of the people in the base area as a factor, we mean that we have an armed people
164
 That is the main reason why the enemy is afraid to approach our base area
74
 Unquestionably, victory or defeat in war is determined mainly by the military, political, economic and natural conditions on both sides
136
 But not by these alone
23
 It is also determined by each side's subjective ability in directing the war
77
 In his endeavour to win a war, a military man cannot overstep the limitations imposed by the material conditions; within these limitations, however, he can and must strive for victory
184
 The stage of action for a military man is built upon objective material conditions, but on that stage he i can direct the performance of many a drama, full of sound and colour, power and grandeur
196
 The object of war is specifically "to preserve oneself and destroy the enemy" (to destroy the enemy means to disarm him or "deprive him of the power to resist", and does not mean to destroy every member of his forces physically)
229
 In ancient warfare, the spear and the shield were used, the spear to attack and destroy the enemy, and the shield to defend and preserve oneself
145
 To the present day, all weapons are still an extension of the spear and the shield
83
 The bomber, the machine-gun, the long-range gun and poison gas are developments of the spear, while the air-raid shelter, the steel helmet, the concrete fortification and the gas mask are developments of the shield
215
 The tank is a new weapon combining the functions of both spear and shield
74
 Attack is the chief means of destroying the enemy, but defence cannot be dispensed with
88
 In attack the immediate object is to destroy the enemy, but at the same time it is self-preservation, because if the enemy is not destroyed, you will be destroyed
163
 In defence the immediate object is to preserve yourself, but at the same time defence is a means of supplementing attack or preparing to go over to the attack
159
 Retreat is in the category of defence and is a continuation of defence, while pursuit is a continuation of attack
114
 It should be pointed out that destruction of the enemy is the primary object of war and self-preservation the secondary, because only by destroying the enemy in large numbers can one effectively preserve oneself
212
 Therefore attack, the chief means of destroying the enemy, is primary, while defence, a supplementary means of destroying the enemy and a means of self-preservation, is secondary
179
 In actual warfare the chief role is played by defence much of the time and by attack for the rest of the time, but if war is taken as a whole, attack remains primary
166
 All the guiding principles of military operations grow out of the one basic principle: to strive to the utmost to preserve one's own strength and destroy that of the enemy
172
 In a revolutionary war, this principle is directly linked with basic political principles
90
 To attain this end, the operations of the armed units take the form of doing their utmost to preserve their own strength on the one hand and destroy the enemies on the other
174
 How then do we justify the encouragement of heroic sacrifice in war? Every war exacts a price, sometimes an extremely high one
127
 Is this not in contradiction with "preserving oneself"? In fact, these is no contradiction at all; to put it more exactly; sacrifice and self-preservation are both opposite and complementary to each other
205
 For such sacrifice is essential not only for destroying the enemy but also for preserving oneself--partial and temporary "non-preservation" (sacrifice, or paying the price) is necessary for the sake of general and permanent preservation
237
 From this basic principle stems the series of principles guiding military operations, all of which--from the principles of shooting (taking cover to preserve oneself, and making full use of fire-power to destroy the enemy) to the principles of strategy--are permeated with the spirit of this basic principle
308
 All technical, tactical and strategic principles represent applications of this basic principle
96
 The principle of preserving oneself and destroying the enemy is the basis of all military principles
101
 Our principles of operation are:   (1) Attack dispersed, isolated enemy forces first; attack concentrated, strong  enemy forces later
134
    (2) Take small and medium cities and extensive rural areas first; take big  cities later
92
    (3) Make wiping out the enemy's effective strength our main objective; do  not make holding or seizing a city or place our main objective
141
 Holding or  seizing a city or place is the outcome of wiping out the enemy's effective  strength, and often a city or place can be held or seized for good only after  it has changed hands a number of times
206
    (4) In every battle, concentrate an absolutely superior force (two, three,  four and sometimes even five or six times the enemy's strength), encircle  the enemy forces completely, strive to wipe them out thoroughly and do not  let any escape from the net
258
 In special circumstances, use the method of  dealing crushing blows to the enemy, that is, concentrate all our strength  to make a frontal attack and also to attack one or both of his flanks, with  the aim of wiping out one part and routing another so that our army can swiftly  move its troops to smash other enemy forces
323
 Strive to avoid battles of attrition  in which we lose more than we gain or only break even
92
 In this way, although  we are inferior as a whole (in terms of numbers), we are absolutely superior  in every part and every specific campaign, and this ensures victory in the  campaign
186
 As time goes on, we shall become superior as a whole and eventually  wipe out all the enemy
92
    (5) Fight no battle unprepared, fight no battle you are not sure of winning;  make every effort to be well prepared for each battle, make every effort  to ensure victory in the given set of conditions as between the enemy and  ourselves
240
    (6) Give full play to our style of fighting -- courage in battle, no fear  of sacrifice, no fear of fatigue, and continuous fighting (that is, fighting  successive battles in a short time without rest)
205
    (7) Strive to wipe out the enemy through mobile warfare
59
 At the same time,  pay attention to the tactics of positional attack and capture enemy fortified  points and cities
116
    (8) With regard to attacking cities, resolutely seize all enemy fortified  points and cities which are weakly defended
122
 Seize at opportune moments all  enemy fortified points and cities defended with moderate strength, provided  circumstances permit
130
 As for strongly defended enemy fortified points and  cities, wait till conditions are ripe and then take them
110
    (9) Replenish our strength with all the arms and most of the personnel captured  from the enemy
99
 Our army's main sources of manpower and mat&eacute;riel are  at the front
74
    (10) Make good use of the intervals between campaigns to rest, train and  consolidate our troops
100
 Periods of rest, training and consolidation should  in general not be very long, and the enemy should so far as possible be permitted  no breathing space
154
  (2) Take small and medium cities and extensive rural areas first; take big  cities later
90
  (3) Make wiping out the enemy's effective strength our main objective; do  not make holding or seizing a city or place our main objective
139
 Holding or  seizing a city or place is the outcome of wiping out the enemy's effective  strength, and often a city or place can be held or seized for good only after  it has changed hands a number of times
206
  (4) In every battle, concentrate an absolutely superior force (two, three,  four and sometimes even five or six times the enemy's strength), encircle  the enemy forces completely, strive to wipe them out thoroughly and do not  let any escape from the net

 Periods of rest, training and consolidation should  in general not be very long, and the enemy should so far as possible be permitted  no breathing space
154
 They are the result of the tempering of the People's Liberation Army in long years of fighting against domestic and foreign enemies and are completely suited to our present situation
183
  our strategy and tactics are based on a people's war; no army opposed to the people can use our strategy and tactics
118
 Without preparedness superiority is not real superiority and there can be no initiative either
95
 Having grasped this point, a force which is inferior but prepared can often defeat a superior enemy by surprise attack
119
 Without a people's army the people have nothing
48
 III, pp
8
 This army is powerful because all its members have a discipline based on political consciousness; they have come together and they fight not for the private interests of a few individuals or a narrow clique, but for the interests of the broad masses and of the whole nation
274
 The Red Army fights not merely for the sake of fighting but in order to conduct propaganda among the masses, organize them, arm them, and help them to establish revolutionary political power
191
 Without these objectives, fighting loses its meaning and the Red Army loses the reason for its existence
105
 The People's Liberation Army is always a fighting force
56
 Even after country-wide victory, our army will remain a fighting force during the historical period in which classes have not been abolished in our country and the imperialist system still exists in the world
209
 On this point there should be no misunderstanding or wavering
62
 We have an army for fighting as well as an army for labour
59
 For fighting we have the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies; but even they do a dual job, warfare and production
113
 Our national defence will be consolidated and no imperialist will be allowed to invade our territory again
107
 Our people's armed forces must be maintained and developed with the brave and steeled People's Liberation Army as their foundation
131
 We will have not only a powerful army but also a powerful air force and a powerful navy
88
 It has recently been found that in some (of course not all) leading bodies it is the habitual practice for one individual to monopolize the conduct of affairs and decide important problems
189
 Differences of opinion among committee members cannot be resolved and are left unresolved for a long time
106
 This situation must be changed
31
 All important problems (of course, not the unimportant, trivial problems, or problems whose solutions have already been decided after discussion at meetings and need only be carried out) must be submitted to the committee for discussion, and the committee members present should express their views fully and reach definite decisions which should then be carried out by the members concerned
392
 Furthermore, we must take care that neither collective leadership nor personal responsibility is overemphasized to the neglect of the other
140
 In the army, the person in command has the right to make emergency decisions during battle and when circumstances require
122
 It is indeed not easy to lead this squad well
46
 Each bureau or sub-bureau of the Central Committee now leads a vast area and shoulders very heavy responsibilities
115
 To lead means not only to decide general and specific policies but also to devise correct methods of work
106
 Even with correct general and specific policies, troubles may still arise if methods of work are neglected
107
 To be a good "squad leader", the secretary should study hard and investigate thoroughly
88
 A secretary or deputy secretary will find it difficult to direct his "squad" well if he does not take care to do propaganda and organizational work among his own "squad members", is not good at handling his relations with committee members or does not study how to run meetings successfully
291
 If the "squad members" do not march in step, they can never expect to lead tens of millions of people in fighting and construction
131
 Of course, the relation between the secretary and the committee members is one in which the minority must obey the majority, so it is different from the relation between a squad leader and his men
197
 Here we speak only by way of analogy
37
 Place problems on the table
28
 This should be done not only by the "squad leader" but by the committee members too
84
 Do not talk behind people's backs
34
 Whenever problems arise, call a meeting, place the problems on the table for discussion, take some decisions and the problems will be solved
141
 If problems exist and are not placed on the table, they will remain unsolved for a long time and even drag on for years
120
 The "squad leader" and the committee members should show understanding in their relations with each other
106
 "Exchange information
22
 This is of great importance in achieving a common language
59
 Some fail to do so and, like the people described by Lao Tzu, "do not visit each other all their lives, though the crowing of their cocks and the barking of their dogs are within hearing of each other"
202
 The result is that they lack a common language
47
 Ask your subordinates about matters you don't understand or don't know, and do not lightly express your approval or disapproval 
129
 We should never pretend to know what we don't know, we should "not feel ashamed to ask and learn from people below" and we should listen carefully to the views of the cadres at the lower levels
194
 Be a pupil before you become a teacher; learn from the cadres at the lower levels before you issue orders 
107
 What the cadres at the lower levels say may or may not be correct; we must analyse it
86
 We must heed the correct views and act upon them 
50
 Listen also to the mistaken views from below; it is wrong not to listen to them at all
87
 Such views, however, are not to be acted upon but to be criticized
67
 Learn to "play the piano"
26
 In playing the piano all ten fingers are in motion; it won't do to move some fingers only and not others
105
 But if all ten fingers press down at once, there is no melody
62
 To produce good music, the ten fingers should move rhythmically and in co-ordination
85
 At present, we have to take care of many fields; we must look after the work in all the areas, armed units and departments, and not give all our attention to a few problems, to the exclusion of others
201
 Wherever there is a problem, we must put our finger on it, and this is a method we must master
95
 Some play the piano well and some badly, and there is a great difference in the melodies they produce
102
 "Grasp firmly
14
 One can get a grip on something only when it is grasped firmly, without the slightest slackening
97
 Not to grasp firmly is not to grasp at all
43
 Naturally, one cannot get a grip on something with an open hand
64
 When the hand is clenched as if grasping something but is not clenched tightly, there is still no grip
103
 Some of our comrades do grasp the main tasks, but their grasp is not firm and so they cannot make a success of their work
122
 It will not do to have no grasp at all, nor will it do if the grasp is not firm
80
 "Have a head for figures
25
" That is to say, we must attend to the quantitative aspect of a situation or problem and make a basic quantitative analysis
124
 Every quality manifests itself in a certain quantity, and without quantity there can be no quality
99
 To this day many of our comrades still do not understand that they must attend to the quantitative aspect of things -- the basic statistics, the main percentages and the quantitative limits that determine the qualities of things
229
 They have no "figures" in their heads and as a result cannot help making mistakes
82
 "Notice to Reassure the Public
31
" Notice of meetings should be given beforehand; this is like issuing a "Notice to Reassure the Public", so that everybody will know what is going to be discussed and what problems are to be solved and can make timely preparations
230
 In some places, meetings of cadres are called without first preparing reports and draft resolutions, and only when people have arrived for the meeting are makeshifts improvised; this is just like the saying, "Troops and horses have arrived, but food and fodder are not ready", and that is no good
297
 Don't call a meeting in a hurry if the preparations are not completed
70
 "Fewer and better troops and simpler administration
52
" Talks, speeches, articles and resolutions should all be concise and to the point
82
 Meetings also should not go on too long
40
 Pay attention to uniting and working with comrades who differ with you
71
 This should be borne in mind both in the localities and in the army
68
 We have come together from every corner of the country and should be good at uniting in our work not only with comrades who hold the same views as we but also with those who hold different views
195
 Guard against arrogance
24
 For anyone in a leading position, this is a matter of principle and an important condition for maintaining unity
113
 Even those who have made no serious mistakes and have achieved very great success in their work should not be arrogant
119
 Draw two lines of distinction
30
 First, between revolution and counter-revolution, between Yenan and Sian
73
[1] Some do not understand that they must draw this line of distinction
71
 For example, when they combat bureaucracy, they speak of Yenan as though "nothing is right" there and fail to make a comparison and distinguish between the bureaucracy in Yenan and the bureaucracy in Sian
205
 This is fundamentally wrong
28
 Secondly, within the revolutionary ranks, it is necessary to make a clear distinction between right and wrong, between achievements and shortcomings and to make clear which of the two is primary and which secondary
215
 For instance, do the achievements amount to 30 per cent or to 70 per cent of the whole? It will not do either to understate or to overstate
140
 We must have a fundamental evaluation of a person's work and establish whether his achievements amount to 30 per cent and his mistakes to 70 per cent, or vice versa
165
 If his achievements amount to 70 per cent of the whole, then his work should in the main be approved
101
 It would be entirely wrong to describe work in which the achievements are primary as work in which the mistakes are primary
124
 In our approach to problems we must not forget to draw these two lines of distinction, between revolution and counter-revolution and between achievements and shortcomings
171
 We shall be able to handle things well if we bear these two distinctions in mind; otherwise we shall confuse the nature of the problems
136
 To draw these distinctions well, careful study and analysis are of course necessary
84
 Our attitude towards every person and every matter should be one of analysis and study
87
 In the sphere of organization, ensure democracy under centralized guidance
75
    (2) The higher bodies must be familiar with the life of the masses and with  the situation in the lower bodies so as to have an objective basis for correct  guidance
169
 Once a decision is reached, it must be firmly carried out

58
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung cited the two cities as symbols of revolution and counter-revolution
90
 The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history
86
 The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant, and without this understanding it is impossible to acquire even the most rudimentary knowledge
179
 The masses have boundless creative power
41
 They can organize themselves and concentrate on places and branches of work where they can give full play to their energy; they can concentrate on production in breadth and depth and create more and more undertakings for their own well-being
242
 The present upsurge of the peasant movement is a colossal event
64
 They will smash all the trammels that bind them and rush forward along the road to liberation
94
 They will sweep all the imperialists, warlords, corrupt officials, local tyrants and evil gentry into their graves
115
 Every revolutionary party and every revolutionary comrade will be put to the test, to be accepted or rejected as they decide
125
 There are three alternatives
29
 The high tide of social transformation in the countryside, the high tide of co-operation, has already reached some places and will soon sweep over the whole country
165
 It is a vast socialist revolutionary movement involving a rural population of more than 500 million, and it has extremely great and world-wide significance
156
 We should give this movement active, enthusiastic and systematic leadership, and not drag it back by one means or another
122
 Some errors are unavoidable in the process; this is understandable, and they will not be hard to correct
105
 Shortcomings or mistakes among cadres and peasants can be remedied or overcome provided we give them positive help
115
 On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation (July 31, 1955), 3rd ed
69
 The masses have a potentially inexhaustible enthusiasm for socialism
69
 Those who can only follow the old routine in a revolutionary period are utterly incapable of seeing this enthusiasm
116
 They are blind and all is dark ahead of them
45
 At times they go so far as to confound right and wrong and turn things upside down
83
 Haven't we come across enough persons of this type? Those who simply follow the old routine invariably underestimate the people's enthusiasm
141
 Let something new appear and they always disapprove and rush to oppose it
74
 Afterwards, they have to admit defeat and do a little self-criticism
69
 But the next time something new appears, they go through the same process all over again
89
 This is their pattern of behaviour in regard to anything and everything new
76
 Such people are always passive, always fail to move forward at the critical moment, and always have to be given a shove in the back before they move a step
156
 We have always maintained that the revolution must rely on the masses of the people, on everybody's taking a hand, and have opposed relying merely on a few persons issuing orders
179
 The mass line, however, is still not being thoroughly carried out in the work of some comrades; they still rely solely on a handful of people working coolly and quietly by themselves
183
 One reason is that, whatever they do, they are always reluctant to explain it to the people they lead and that they do not understand why or how to give play to the initiative and creative energy of those they lead
215
 Subjectively, they too want everyone to take a hand in the work, but they do not let other people know what is to be done or how to do it
138
 That being the case, how can everyone be expected to get moving and how can anything be done well? To solve this problem the basic thing is, of course, to carry out ideological education on the mass line, but at the same time we must teach these comrades many concrete methods of work
285
 Twenty-four years of experience tell us that the right task, policy and style of work invariably conform with the demands of the masses at a given time and place and invariably strengthen our ties with the masses, and the wrong task, policy and style of work invariably disagree with the demands of the masses at a given time and place and invariably alienate us from the masses
379
 The reason why such evils as dogmatism, empiricism, commandism, tailism, sectarianism, bureaucracy and an arrogant attitude in work are definitely harmful and intolerable, and why anyone suffering from these maladies must overcome them, is that they alienate us from the masses
278
 To link oneself with the masses, one must act in accordance with the needs and wishes of the masses
100
 All work done for the masses muststart from their needs and not from the desire of any individual, however well-intentioned
124
 It often happens that objectively the masses need a certain change, but subjectively they are not yet conscious of the need, not yet willing or determined to make the change
174
 In such cases, we should wait patiently
40
 We should not make the change until, through our work, most of the masses have become conscious of the need and are willing and determined to carry it out
155
 Otherwise we shall isolate ourselves from the masses
53
 Unless they are conscious and willing, any kind of work that requires their participation will turn out to be a mere formality and will fail 
142
 There are two principles here: one is the actual needs of the masses rather than what we fancy they need, and the other is the wishes of the masses, who must make up their own minds instead of our making up their minds for them
228

 It should teach every comrade to love the people and listen attentively to the voice of the masses; to identify himself with the masses wherever he goes and, instead of standing above them, to immerse himself among them; and, according to their present level, to awaken them or raise their political consciousness and help them gradually to organize themselves voluntarily and to set going all essential struggles permitted by the internal and external circumstances of the given time and place
495
 III, pp

 If we tried to go on the offensive when the masses are not yet awakened, that would be adventurism
99
 If we insisted on leading the masses to do anything against their will, we would certainly fail
96
 If we did not advance when the masses demand advance, that would be Right opportunism
86
 Commandism is wrong in any type of work, because in overstepping the level of political consciousness of the masses and violating the principle of voluntary mass action it reflects the disease of impetuosity
208
 Our comrades must not assume that everything they themselves understand is understood by the masses
100
 Whether the masses understand it and are ready to take action can be discovered only by going into their midst and making investigations
137
 If we do so, we can avoid commandism
37
 Tailism in any type of work is also wrong, because in falling below the level of political consciousness of the masses and violating the principle of leading the masses forward it reflects the disease of dilatoriness
217
 Our comrades must not assume that the masses have no understanding of what they themselves do not yet understand
113
 It often happens that the masses outstrip us and are eager to advance a step when our comrades are still tailing behind certain backward elements, for instead of acting as leaders of the masses such comrades reflect the views of these backward elements and, moreover, mistake them for those of the broad masses
311
 Take the ideas of the masses and concentrate them, then got to the masses, persevere in the ideas and carry them through, so as to form correct ideas of leadership--such is the basic method of leadership
204
 This means: take the ideas of the masses (scattered and unsystematic ideas) and concentrate them (through study turn them into concentrated and systematic ideas), then go to the masses and propagate and explain these ideas until the masses embrace them as their own, hold fast to them and translate them into action, and test the correctness of these ideas in such action
372
 Then once again concentrate ideas from the masses and once again go to the masses so that the ideas are persevered in and carried through
138
 And so on, over and over again in an endless spiral, with the ideas becoming more correct, more vital and richer each time
123
 Such is the Marxist theory of knowledge
40
 We should go to the masses and learn from them, synthesize their experience into better, articulated principles and methods, then do propaganda among the masses, and call upon them to put these principles and methods into practice so as to solve their problems and help them achieve liberation and happiness
308
 This is one of the basic reasons why some of our work cannot be done well
74
 In all mass movements we must make a basic investigation and analysis of the number of active supporters, opponents and neutrals and must not decide problems subjectively and without basis
189
 The masses in any given place are generally composed of three parts, the relatively active, the intermediate and the relatively backward
137
 The leaders must therefore be skilled in uniting the small number of active elements around the leadership and must rely on them to raise the level of the intermediate element and to win over the backward elements
214
 It is also the dividing line that determines whether or not we make mistakes in our work
89
 However active the leading group may be, its activity will amount to fruitless effort by a handful of people unless combined with the activity of the masses
157
 On the other hand, if the masses alone are active without a strong leading group to organize their activity properly, such activity cannot be sustained for long, or carried forward in the right direction, or raised to a high level
231
 Production by the masses, the interests of the masses, the experiences and feelings of the masses -- to these the leading cadres should pay constant attention
159
 We should pay close attention to the well-being of the masses, from the problems of land and labour to those of fuel, rice, cooking oil and salt
145
 All such problems concerning the well-being of the masses should be placed on our agenda
89
 We should discuss them, adopt and carry out decisions and check up on the results
82
 We should help the masses to realize that we represent their interests, that our lives are intimately bound up with theirs
123
 We should help them to proceed from these things to an understanding of the higher tasks which we have put forward, the tasks of the revolutionary war, so that they will support the revolution and spread it throughout the country, respond to our political appeals and fight to the end for victory in the revolution
315
 [1] The Red Army, which was founded in 1927, and the Eighth Route Army of today have inherited this system and developed it
124
 The People's Liberation Army has developed its vigorous revolutionary political work, which is an important factor in winning victory over the enemy, on the basis of a people's war and of the principles of unity between army and people, of unity between commanders and fighters and of disintegrating the enemy troops
317
 This army has built up a system of political work which is essential for the people's war and is aimed at promoting unity in its own ranks, unity with the friendly armies and unity with the people, and at disintegrating the enemy forces and ensuring victory in battle
268
 Political work is the life-blood of all economic work
54
 This is particularly true at a time when the social and economic system is undergoing fundamental change
105
 The political work of the Eighth Route Army is guided by three basic principles
80
 First, the principle of unity between officers and men, which means eradicating feudal practices in the army, prohibiting beating and abuse, building up a conscious discipline, and sharing weal and woe--as a result of which the entire army is closely united
258
 Second, the principle of unity between the army and the people, which means maintaining a discipline that forbids the slightest violation of the people's interests, conducting propaganda among the masses, organizing and arming them, lightening their financial burdens and suppressing the traitors and collaborators who do harm to the army and the people--as a result of which the army is closely united with the people and welcomed everywhere
443
 Third, the principle of disintegrating the enemy troops and giving lenient treatment to prisoners of war
105
 Our victory depends not only upon our military operations but also upon the disintegration of the enemy troops
111
 III, pp

 Among the prisoners, those who were coerced into joining the reactionary forces but who are more or less inclined towards the revolution should be won over in large numbers to work for our army
194
 The rest should be released and, if they fight us and are captured again, should again be set free
99
 We should not insult them, take away their personal effects or try to exact recantations from them, but without exception should treat them sincerely and kindly
161
 This should be our policy, however reactionary they may be
59
 It is a very effective way of isolating the hard core of reaction
66
 Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; it is people, not things, that are decisive
113
 The contest of strength is not only a contest of military and economic power, but also a contest of human power and morale
123
 Military and economic power is necessarily wielded by people
61
 The atom bomb is a paper tiger which the US reactionaries use to scare people
78
 It looks terrible, but in fact it isn't
40
 Of course, the atom bomb is a weapon of mass slaughter, but the outcome of a war is decided by the people, not by one or two new types of weapon
145
 Soldiers are the foundation of an army; unless they are imbued with a progressive political spirit, and unless such a spirit is fostered through progressive political work, it will be impossible to achieve genuine unity between officers and men, impossible to arouse their enthusiasm for the War of Resistance to the full, and impossible to provide a sound basis for the most effective use of all our technical equipment and tactics
433
 The purely military viewpoint is very highly developed among a number of comrades in the Red Army
98
 These comrades regard military affairs and politics as opposed to each other and refuse to recognize that military affairs are only one means of accomplishing political tasks
175
 Some even say, "If you are good militarily, naturally you are good politically; if you are not good militarily, you cannot be any good politically"--this is to go a step further and give military affairs a leading position over politics
237
 Recently there has been a falling off in ideological and political work among students and intellectuals, and some unhealthy tendencies have appeared
150
 Some people seem to think that there is no longer any need to concern themselves with politics or with the future of the motherland and the ideals of mankind
158
 It seems as if Marxism, once all the rage, is currently not so much in fashion
79
 To counter these tendencies, we must strengthen our ideological and political work
83
 Both students and intellectuals should study hard
50
 In addition to the study of their specialized subjects, they must make progress ideologically and politically, which means they should study Marxism, current events and politics
178
 Not to have a correct political orientation is like having no soul
67
  All departments and organizations should shoulder their responsibilities for ideological and political work
109

 After receiving political education, the Red Army soldiers have become class-conscious and learned the essentials of distributing land, setting up political power, arming the workers and peasants, etc
201
, and they all know they are fighting for themselves, for the working class and the peasantry
93
 Hence they can endure the hardships of the bitter struggle without complaint
77
 Each company, battalion or regiment has its soldiers' committee which represents the interests of the soldiers and carries on political and mass work
150
 On this basis, the army achieved greater purity in its ranks, strengthened discipline, unfolded a mass movement for training and further developed its political, economic and military democracy in a completely well-led and orderly way
235
 Thus the army has become united as one man, with everybody contributing his ideas and his strength, fearless of sacrifice and capable of overcoming material difficulties, an army which displays mass heroism and daring in destroying the enemy
242
 Such an army will be invincible
32
 In the last few months almost all the People's Liberation Army has made use of the intervals between battles for large-scale training and consolidation
152
 This has been carried out in a fully guided, orderly and democratic way
72
 It has therefore aroused the revolutionary fervour of the great masses of commanders and fighters, enabled them clearly to comprehend the aim of the war, eliminated certain incorrect ideological tendencies and undesirable manifestations in the army, educated the cadres and fighters and greatly enhanced the combat effectiveness of the army
341
 From now on, we must continue to carry on this new type of ideological education movement in the army, a movement which has a democratic and mass character
156
 It is in accordance with these essentials that the staff teach and the students study
86
 To Be Attacked by the Enemy Is Not a Bad Thing but a Good Thing (May 26, 1939), 1st pocket ed

 Our nation has always had a traditional style of hard struggle, which we should develop
88
  This orientation is inseperable from a style of hard struggle
63
 Without the style of hard struggle, it is impossible to maintain a firm and correct political orientation
106
 Be united, alert, earnest and lively
37
 (November 17, 1957)
20
 Our army has always had two policies
37
 First, we must be ruthless to our enemies, we must overpower and annihilate them
81
 Second, we must be kind to our own, to the people, to our comrades and to our superiors and subordinates, and unite with them
126
 We hail from all corners of the country and have joined together for a common revolutionary objective
102
 And we need the vast majority of the people with us on the road to this objective
82
  Our cadres must show concern for every soldier, and all people in the revolutionary ranks must care for each other, must love and help each other
147
 III, pp
8
 A movement to support the cadres and cherish the soldiers should be launched in every army unit, calling on the cadres to chreish the soldiers and the soldiers to support the cadres
182
 They should speak up about each other's shortcomings and mistakes and quickly correct them
91
 In this way they will be able to achieve a very good internal unity
68
 Many people think that it is wrong methods that make for strained relations between officers and men and between the army and the people, but I always tell them that it is a question of basic attitude (or basic principle), of having respect for the soldiers and the people
273
 It is from this attitude that the various policies, methods and forms ensue
76
 If we depart from this attitude, then the policies, methods and forms will certainly be wrong, and the relations between officers and men and between the army and the people are bound to be unsatisfactory
205
 Our three major principles for the army's political work are, first, unity between officers and men; second, unity between the army and the people; and third, the disintegration of the enemy forces
198
 To apply these principles effectively, we must start with this basic attitude of respect for the soldiers and the people, and of respect for the human dignity of prisoners of war once they have laid down their arms
215
 Those who take all this as a technical matter and not one of basic attitude are indeed wrong, and they should correct their view
129
 Communists must use the democratic method of persuasion and education when working among the labouring people and must on no account resort to commandism or coercion
166
 On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
94
 Our comrades must understand that ideological remoulding involves long-term, patient and painstaking work, and they must not attempt to change people's ideology, which has been shaped over decades of life, by giving a few lectures or by holding a few meetings
260
 Persuasion, not coercion, is the only way to convince people
61
 Coercion will never result in convincing people
48
 To try to convince them submit by force simply won't do
56
 This kind of method is permissible in dealing with the enemy, but absolutely impermissible in dealing with comrades or friends
127
 We must make a distinction between the enemy and ourselves, and we must not adopt an antagonistic stand towards comrades and treat them as we would the enemy
158
 In speaking up, one must have an ardent desire to protect the cause of the people and raise their political consciousness, and there must be no ridiculing or attacking in one's approach
186
 The army must become one with the people so that they see it as their own army
79
 Such an army will be invincible 
33
 Every comrade must be helped to understand that as long as we rely on the people, believe firmly in the inexhaustible creative power of the masses and hence trust and identify ourselves with them, we can surmount any difficulty, and no enemy can crush us while we can crush any enemy
284
 Wherever our comrades go, they must build good relations with the masses, be concerned for them and help them overcome their difficulties
138
 We must unite with the masses; the more of the masses we unite with, the better
80
 In this way relations between the army and the people will become still better
79
 In the army the task of supporting the government and cherishing the people should be handled through the ideological education of every commander and fighter, so that they all thoroughly understand its importance
214
 As long as the army on its part does this job well, the local government and the people will also improve their relations with the army
136
 A proper measure of democracy should be put into effect in the army, chiefly by abolishing the feudal practice of bullying and beating and by having officers and men share weal and woe
185
 Once this is done, unity will be achieved between officers and men, the combat effectiveness of the army will be greatly increased, and there will be no doubt of our ability to sustain the long, cruel war
205
 The officers do not beat the men; officers and men receive equal treatment, soldiers are free to hold meetings and to speak out; trivial formalities have been done away with; and the accounts are open for all to inspect 
221
 Democracy in our army is an important weapon for undermining the feudal mercenary army
87
 The policy for political work in our army units is fully to arouse the rank and file, the commanders and all working personnel in order to achieve three major objectives through a democratic movement under centralized leadership, namely, a high degree of political unity, better living conditions, and better military technique and tactics
340
 The Three Check-ups and Three Improvements [1] now being enthusiastically carried out in our army units are intended to attain the first two of these objectives through the methods of political and economic democracy
217
 With regard to economic democracy, the representatives elected by the soldiers must be ensured the right to assist (but not to bypass) the company leadership in managing the company's supplies and mess
202
 With regard to military democracy, in periods of training there must be mutual instruction as between officers and soldiers and among the soldiers themselves; and in periods of fighting the companies at the front must hold big and small meetings of various kinds
263
 Under the direction of the company leadership, the rank and file should be roused to discuss how to attack and capture enemy positions and how to fulfil other combat tasks
172
 When the fighting lasts several days, several such meetings should be held
75
 This kind of military democracy was practiced with great success in the battle of Panlung in northern Shensi and in the battle of Shihchiachuang in the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei area
177
 It has been proved that the practice can only do good and can do no harm whatsoever
84
 Selected Military Writings, 2nd ed
35
 Otherwise, "initiative" will be an empty thing
47
 Only in an atmosphere of democracy can large numbers of able people be brought forward
87
 Anyone should be allowed to speak out, whoever he may be, so long as he is not a hostile element and does not make malicous attacks, and it does not matter if he says something wrong
183
 Leaders at all levels have the duty to listen to others
56
 Two principles must be observed: (1) Say all you know and say it without reserve; (2) Don't blame the speaker but take his words as a warning
142
 Unless the principle of "Don't blame the speaker" is observed genuinely and not falsely, the result will not be "Say all you know and say it without reserve"
158
 In the sphere of theory, destroy the roots of ultra-democracy
62
 Next, it should be pointed out that the source of ultra-democracy consists in the petty bourgeoisie's individualistic aversion to discipline
141
 These ideas are utterly incompatible with the fighting tasks of the proletariat
80
 In the localities, the "Three Check-ups" meant checking on class origin, ideology and style of work; in the armed units, the check-ups were on class origin, performance of duty and will to fight
195
 The "Three Improvements" meant organizational consolidation, ideological education and rectification of style of work
118
 Our educational policy must enable everyone who receives an education to develop morally, intellectually and physically and become a worker with both socialist consciousness and culture

 For a military school, the most important question is the selection of a director and instructors and the adoption of an educational policy
140
 A school of a hundred people certainly cannot be run well if it does not have a leading group of several people; or a dozen or more, which is formed in accordance with the actual circumstances (and not thrown together artificially) and is composed of the most active, upright and alert of the teachers, the other staff and the students
336

 All officers and fighters of our army must improve their military art, march forward courageously towards sure victory in the war and resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and completely wipe out all enemies
201
 Equal importance should be attatched to the military and political aspects of the one-year consolidation and training programme which has just begun, and the two aspects should be integrated
191
 At the start, stress should be placed on the political aspect, on improving relations between officers and men, enhancing internal unity and arousing a high level of enthusiasm among the masses of cadres and fighters
217
 Only thus will the military consolidation and training proceed smoothly and attain better results
98
 As for the method of training, we should unfold the mass training movement in which officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers and the soldiers teach each other
167
 Our slogan in training troops is, "Officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers and soldiers teach each other"
115
 The fighters have a lot of practical combat experience
55
 The officers should learn from the fighters, and when they have made other people's experience their own, they will become more capable
136
 As for the training courses, the main objective should still be to raise the level of technique in marksmanship, bayoneting, grenade-throwing and the like and the secondary objective should be to raise the level of tactics, while special emphasis should be laid on night operations
282
 The organs of state must practise democratic centralism, they must rely on the masses and their personnel must serve the people

 Comrade Bethune's spirit, his utter devotion to others without any thought of self, was shown in his great sense of responsibility in his work and his great warm-heartedness towards all comrades and the people
210
 Every Communist must learn from him
36
 We must all learn the spirit of absolute selflessness from him
63
 With this spirit everyone can be very useful to the people
59
 A man's ability may be great or small, but if he has this spirit, he is already noble-minded and pure, a man of moral integrity and above vulgar interests, a man who is of value to the people
192
 These battalions of ours are wholly dedicated to the liberation of the people and work entirely in the people's interests
122
 All our cadres, whatever their rank, are servants of the people, and whatever we do is to serve the people
107
 Our duty is to hold ourselves responsible to the people
56
 Every word, every act and every policy must conform to the people's interests, and if mistakes occur, they must be corrected -- that is what being responsible to the people means
179
 Wherever there is struggle there is sacrifice, and death is a common occurrence
80
 But we have the interests of the people and the sufferings of the great majority at heart, and when we die for the people it is a worthy death
143
 Nevertheless, we should do our best to avoid unnecessary sacrifices
68
 All men must die, but death can vary in its significance
57
" To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai, but to work for the fascists and die for the exploiters and oppressors is lighter than a feather
149
 Can a Communist, who is an internationalist, at the same time be a patriot? We hold that he not only can be but must be
120
 The specific content of patriotism is determined by historical conditions
74
 We are at once internationalists and patriots, and our slogan is, "Fight to defend the motherland against the aggressors
121
" For us defeatism is a crime and to strive for victory in the War of Resistance is an inescapable duty
103
 For only by fighting in defence of the motherland can we defeat the aggressors and achieve national liberation
111
 And only by achieving national liberation will it be possible for the proletariat and other working people to achieve their own emancipation
141
 Thus in wars of national liberation patriotism is applied internationalism
75
 This is our internationalism, the internationalism with which we oppose both narrow nationalism and narrow patriotism
118
 In the fight for complete liberation the oppressed people rely first of all on their own struggle and then, and only then, on international assistance
151
 The people who have triumphed in their own revolution should help those still struggling for liberation
104
 This is our internationalist duty
34
 The socialist countries are states of an entirely new type in which the exploiting classes have been overthrown and the working people are in power
148
 The principle of integrating internationalism with patriotism is practised in the relations between these countries
116
 We are closely bound by common interests and common ideals

 The people of the countries in the socialist camp should unite, the people of the countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America should unite, the people of all the continents should unite, all peace-loving countries should unite, and all countries subjected to US aggression, control, intervention or bullying should unite, and so form the broadest united front to oppose the US imperialist policies of aggression and war and to defend world peace

 Things develop ceaselessly

 She will have become a powerful socialist industrial country
61
 And that is as it should be
28
 Her contribution over a long period has been far too small
59
 For this we are regretful
26
 However, we should be modest -- not only now, but forty-five years hence as well
81
 We should always be modest

 We must never adopt an arrogant attitude of great-power chauvinism and become conceited because of the victory of our revolution and certain achievements in our construction
174
 Every nation, big or small, has its strong and weak points
59
 This army has an indomitable spirit and is determined to vanquish all enemies and never to yield
97
 No matter what the difficulties and hardships, so long as a single man remains, he will fight on
97
 Give full play to our style of fighting -- courage in battle, no fear of sacrifice, no fear of fatigue, and continuous fighting (that is, fighting successive battles in a short time without rest)
196
 Be resolute, fear no sacrifice and surmount every difficulty to win victory
76
 They picked themselves up, wiped off the blood, buried their fallen comrades and went into battle again
104
 You have many good qualities and have rendered great service, but you must always remember not to become conceited
115
 You are respected by all, and quite rightly, but this easily leads to conceit
78
 If you become conceited, if you are not modest and cease to exert yourselves, and if you do not respect others, do not respect the cadres and the masses, then you will cease to be heroes and models
198
 There have been such people in the past, and I hope you will not follow their example
86
 In the fight to wipe out the enemy and to restore and increase industrial and agricultural production, you have overcome many difficulties and hardships and demonstrated immense courage, wisdom and initiative
209
 We must see to it that all our cadres and all our people constantly bear in mind that ours is a large socialist country but an economically backward and poor one, and that this is a very great contradiction

 Diligence and thrift should be practiced in running factories, shops and all state-owned, co-operative and other enterprises
125
 The principle of diligence and frugality should be observed in everything
74
 It is the principle of economy is one of the basic principles of socialist economics
85
 Even then we still have to observe the principle of diligence and frugality
76
 But it is in the coming decades, during the present series of five-year plans, that we must particularly advocate diligence and frugality, that we must pay special attention to economy
185
 Wherever we happen to be, we must treasure our manpower and material resources, and must not take a short view and indulge in wastefulness and extravagance
156
 Wherever we are, from the very first year of our work we must bear in mind the many years to come, the protracted war that must be maintained, the counter-offensive, and the work of reconstruction after the enemy's expulsion
225
 On the one hand, never be wasteful or extravagant; on the other, actively expand production
92
 Previously, in some places people suffered a great deal because they did not take the long view and neglected economy in manpower and material resources and the expansion of production
185
 The lesson is there and attention must be called to it
55
 In order to speed up this restoration and development [of agricultural production and industrial production in small towns], we must do our utmost, in the course of our struggle for the abolition of the feudal system, to preserve all useful means of production and of livelihood, take resolute measures against anyone's destroying or wasting them, oppose extravagant eating and drinking and pay attention to thrift and economy
427
 Thrift should be the guiding principle in our government expenditure
69
 It should be made clear to all government workers that corruption and waste are very great crimes
98
 Our campaigns against corruption and waste have already achieved some results, but further efforts are required
112
 Our system of accounting must be guided by the principle of saving every copper for the war effort, for the revolutionary cause and for our economic construction
162
 A dangerous tendency has shown itself of late among many of our personnel -- an unwillingness to share the joys and hardships of the masses, a concern for personal fame and gain
178
 This is very bad
17
 One way of overcoming it is to simplify our organizations in the course of our campaign to increase production and practice economy, and to transfer cadres to lower levels so that a considerable number will return to productive work
233

 Production by the army for its own support has not only improved the army's living conditions and lightened the burden on the people, thereby making it possible further to expand the army
188
 In addition, it has had many immediate side-effects
52
 They are as follows:   (1) Improved relations between officers and men
71
 Officers and men work together  in production and become like brothers
71
    (2) Better attitude to labour
33
  since the army began to produce  for its own support, the attitude to labour has improved and loafer ways  have been overcome
127
    (3) Strengthened discipline
31
 Far from weakening discipline in battle and  in army life, labour discipline in production actually strengthens it
115
    (4) Improved relations between the army and the people
58
 Once an armed force  begins to "keep house" for itself, encroachments upon the property of the  people seldom or never occur
125
 As the army and the people exchange labour  and help each other in production, the friendship between them is strengthened
123
    (5) Less grumbling in the army about the government and improved relations  between the two
95
    (6) An impetus to the great production campaign of the people
65
 Once the army  engages in production, the need for government and other organizations to  do likewise becomes more obvious, and they do so more energetically; also,  the need for a universal campaign of the whole people to increase production  naturally becomes more obvious, and this too is carried on more energetically
322

 Some people say that if the army units go in for production, they will be unable to train or fight and that if the government and other organizations do so, they will be unable to do their own work
198
 This is a false argument

 In recent years our army units in the Border Region have undertaken production on a big scale to provide themselves with ample food and clothing and have simultaneously done their training and conducted their political studies and literacy and other courses much more successfully than before, and there is greater unity than ever within the army and between the army and the people
383
 While there was a large-scale production campaign at the front last year, great successes were gained in the fighting and in addition an extensive training campaign was started
177
 And thanks to production, the personnel of the government and other organizations live a better life and work with greater devotion and efficiency; this is the case both in the Border Region and at the front

 On what basis should our policy rest? It should rest on our own strength, and that means regeneration through one's own efforts
128
 We are not alone; all the countries and people in the world opposed to imperialism are our friends
99
 Nevertheless, we stress regeneration through our own efforts
61
 We stand for self-reliance
27
 We hope for foreign aid but cannot be dependent on it; we depend on our own efforts, on the creative power of the whole army and the entire people

 To win countrywide victory is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li
85
 The comrades must be taught to remain modest, prudent and free from arrogance and rashness in their style of work
114
 The comrades must be taught to preserve the style of plain living and hard struggle
84
 We must thoroughly clear away all ideas amoung our cadres of winning easy victories through good luck, without hard and bitter struggle, without sweat and blood
161
 We should carry on constant propaganda among the people on the facts of world progress and the bright future ahead so that they will build their confidence in victory
167
 At the same time, we must tell the people and tell our comrades that there will be twists and turns in our road
112
 There are still many obstacles and difficulties along the road of revolution
77
 Some comrades do not like to think much about difficulties
59
 But difficulties are facts; we must recognize as many difficulties as there are and should not adopt a "policy of non-recognition"
131
 We must recognize difficulties, analyse them and combat them
61
 There are no straight roads in the world; we must be prepared to follow a road which twists and turns and not try to get things on the cheap
141
 It must not be imagined that one fine morning all the reactionaries will go down on their knees of their own accord
116
 In a word, while the prospects are bright, the road has twists and turns
73
 There are still many difficulties ahead which we must not overlook
67
 By uniting with the entire people in a common effort, we can certainly overcome all difficulties and win victory
113
 The wealth of society is created by the workers, peasants and working intellectuals
84
 If they take their destiny into their own hands, follow a Marxist-Leninist line and take an active attitude in solving problems instead of evading them, there will be no difficulty in the world which they cannot overcome
221
 The reactionary forces and we both have difficulties
53
 But the difficulties of the reactionary forces are insurmountable because they are forces on the verge of death and have no future
131
 Our difficulties can be overcome because we are new and rising forces and have a bright future
95
 In times of difficulty we must not lose sight of our achievements, must see the bright future and must pluck up our courage

 New things always have to experience difficulties and setbacks as they grow

 It is sheer fantasy to imagine that the cause of socialism is all plain sailing and easy success, without difficulties and setbacks or the exertion of tremendous efforts

 On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocked ed
94
 At certain times in the revolutionary struggle, the difficulties outweigh the favourable conditions and so constitute the principal aspect of the contradiction and the favourable conditions constitute the secondary aspect
222
 But through their efforts the revolutionaries can overcome the difficulties step by step and open up a favourable new situation; thus a difficult situation yields place to a favourable one
189
 What is work? Work is struggle
31
 There are difficulties and problems in those places for us to overcome and solve
81
 We go there to work and struggle to overcome these difficulties
64
 A good comrade is one who is more eager to go where the difficulties are greater
81
 His house faced south and beyond his doorway stood the two great peaks, Taihang and Wangwu, obstructing the way
112
 He called his sons, and hoe in hand they began to dig up these mountains with great determination
98
 Another graybeard, known as the Wise Old Man, saw them and said derisively, "How silly of you to do this! It is quite impossible for you few to dig up those two huge mountains
176
" The Foolish Old Man replied, "When I die, my sons will carry on; when they die, there will be my grandsons, and then their sons and grandsons, and so on to infinity
166
 High as they are, the mountains cannot grow any higher and with every bit we dig, they will be that much lower
111
 Why can't we clear them away?" Having refuted the Wise Old Man's wrong view, he went on digging every day, unshaken in his conviction
134
 God was moved by this, and he sent down two angels, who carried the mountains away on their backs
98
 One is imperialism, the other is feudalism
43
 We must persevere and work unceasingly, and we, too, will touch God's heart
76
 The history of mankind is one of continuous development from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom
108
 This process is never-ending
29
 In any society in which classes exist class struggle will never end
68
 In classless society the struggle between the new and the old and between truth and falsehood will never end
109
 In the fields of the struggle for production and scientific experiment, mankind makes constant progress and nature undergoes constant change; they never remain at the same level
178
 Therefore, man has constantly to sum up experience and go on discovering, inventing, creating and advancing
108
 Ideas of stagnation, pessimism inertia and complacency are all wrong
69
 They are wrong because they agree neither with the historical facts of social development over the past million years, nor with the historical facts of nature so far known to us (ie, nature as revealed in the history of celestial bodies, the earth, life, and other natural phenomena)
284
 Natural science is one of man's weapons in his fight for freedom
65
 For the purpose of attaining freedom in society, man must use social science to understand and change society and carry out social revolution
142
 For the purpose of attaining freedom in the world of nature, man must use natural science to understand, conquer and change nature and thus attain freedom from nature
167
 The Marxist philosophy of dialectical materialism has two outstanding characteristics
86
 One is its class nature: it openly avows that dialectical materialism is in the service of the proletariat
107
 The other is its practicality: it emphasizes the dependence of theory on practice, emphasizes that theory is based on practice and in turn serves practice
155
 Marxist philosophy holds that the most important problem does not lie in understanding the laws of the objective world and thus being able to explain it, but in applying the knowledge of these laws actively to change the world
227
 Where do correct ideas come from? Do they drop from the skies? No
66
 Are they innate in the mind? No
32
 They come from social practice, and from it alone; they come from three kinds of social practice, the struggle for production, the class struggle and scientific experiment
172
 Where Do Correct Ideas Come From? (May 1963), 1st pocket ed
60
 It is man's social being that determines his thinking
54
 Once the correct ideas characteristic of the advanced class are grasped by the masses, these ideas turn into a material force which changes society and changes the world
170
 In their social practice, men engage in various kinds of struggle and gain rich experience, both from their successes and from their failures
142
 Countless phenomena of the objective external world are reflected in a man's brain through his five sense organs&#151; the organs of sight, heating, smell, taste and touch
172
 At first, knowledge is perceptual
34
 The leap to conceptual knowledge, ie, to ideas, occurs when sufficient perceptual knowledge is accumulated
107
 This is one process in cognition
33
 It is the first stage in the whole process of cognition, the stage leading from objective matter to subjective consciousness, from existence to ideas
150
 Whether or not one's consciousness or ideas (including theories, policies, plans or measures) do correctly reflect the laws of the objective external world is not yet proved at this stage, in which it is not yet possible to ascertain whether they are correct or not
266
 Then comes the second stage in the process of cognition, the stage leading from consciousness back to matter, from ideas back to existence, in which the knowledge gained in the first stage is applied in social practice to ascertain whether the theories, policies, plans or measures meet with the anticipated success
316
 Generally speaking, those that succeed are correct and those that fail are incorrect, and this is especially true of man's struggle with nature
144
 In social struggle, the forces representing the advanced class sometimes suffer defeat not because their ideas are incorrect but because, in the balance of forces engaged in struggle, they are not as powerful for the time being as the forces of reaction; they are therefore temporarily defeated, but they are bound to triumph sooner or later
342
 Man's knowledge makes another leap through the test of practice
64
 This leap is more important than the previous one
50
 For it is this leap alone that can prove the correctness or incorrectness of the first leap in cognition, ie, of the ideas, theories, policies, plans or measures formulated in the course of reflecting the objective external world
230
 There is no other way of testing truth
39
 Often, correct knowledge can be arrived at only after many repetitions of the process leading from matter to consciousness and then back to matter, that is, leading from practice to knowledge and then back to practice
218
 Such is the Marxist theory of knowledge, the dialectical materialist theory of knowledge
89
 Whoever wants to know a thing has no way of doing so except by coming into contact with it, that is, by living (practising) in its environment
143
 If you want knowledge, you must take part in the practice of changing reality
78
 If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear by eating it yourself
88
  If you want to know the theory and methods of revolution, you must take part in revolution
92
 All genuine knowledge originates in direct experience
54
 299- 300
9
 Knowledge begins with practice, and theoretical knowledge is acquired through practice and must then return to practice
120
 The active function of knowledge manifests itself not only in the active leap from perceptual to rational knowledge, but--and this is more important--it must manifest itself in the leap from rational knowledge to revolutionary practice
236
 It is well known that when you do anything, unless you understand its actual circumstances, its nature and its relations to other things, you will not know the laws governing it, or know how to do it, or be able to do it well
226
 If a man wants to succeed in his work, that is, to achieve the anticipated results, he must bring his ideas into correspondence with the laws of the objective external world; if they do not correspond, he will fail in his practice
231
 After he fails, he draws his lessons, corrects his ideas to make them correspond to the laws of the external world, and can thus turn failure into success; this is what is meant by "failure is the mother of success" and "a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit"
262
 296- 97

 We are Marxists, and Marxism teaches that in our approach to a problem we should start from objective facts, not from abstract definitions, and that we should derive our guiding principles, policies and measures from an analysis of these facts
244
 The most fundamental method of work which all Communists must firmly bear in mind is to determine our working policies according to actual conditions
150
 When we study the causes of the mistakes we have made, we find that they all arose because we departed from the actual situation at a given time and place and were subjective in our working policies
199
 Idealism and metaphysics are the easiest things in the world, because people can talk as much nonsense as they like without basing it on objective reality or having it tested against reality
191
 Materialism and dialectics, on the other hand, need effort
59
 They must be based on and tested by objective reality
54
 Unless one makes the effort, one is liable to slip into idealism and metaphysics
81
 When we look at a thing, we must examine its essence and treat its appearance merely as an usher at the threshold, and once we cross the threshold, we must grasp the essence of the thing; this is the only reliable and scientific method of analysis
248
 The fundamental cause of the development of a thing is not external but internal; it lies in the contradictoriness within the thing
132
 There is internal contradiction in every single thing, hence its motion and development
88
 Contradictoriness within a thing is the fundamental cause of its development, while its interrelations and interactions with other things are secondary causes
159
 It [materialist dialectics] holds that external causes are the condition of change and internal causes are the basis of change, and that external causes become operative through internal causes
194
 In a suitable temperature an egg changes into a chicken, but no temperature can change a stone into a chicken, because each has a different basis
146
 Marxist philosophy holds that the law of the unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the universe
103
 This law operates universally, whether in the natural world, in human society, or in man's thinking
100
 Between the opposites in a contradiction there is at once unity and struggle, and it is this that impels things to move and change
131
 Contradictions exist everywhere, but they differ in accordance with the different nature of different things
109
 In any given phenomenon or thing, the unity of opposites is conditional, temporary and transitory, and hence relative, whereas the struggle of opposites is absolute
165
 On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
94
 The analytical method is dialectical
37
 By analysis, we mean analysing the contradictions in things
60
 And sound analysis is impossible without intimate knowledge of life and without real understanding of the pertinent contradictions
131
 Concrete analysis of concrete conditions, Lenin said, is "the most essential thing in Marxism, the living soul of Marxism"
123
 Lacking an analytical approach, many of our comrades do not want to go deeply into complex matters, to analyse and study them over and over again, but like to draw simple conclusions which are either absolutely affirmative or absolutely negative
246
  From now on we should remedy this state of affairs
52
 The way these comrades look at problems is wrong
49
 They do not look at the essential or main aspects but emphasize the non-essential or minor ones
96
 It should be pointed out that these non-essential or minor aspects must not be overlooked and must be dealt with one by one
124
 But they should not be taken as the essential or main aspects, or we will lose our bearings
92
 On the Question of of Agricultural Co-operation (July 31, 1955), 3rd ed
72
 In this world, things are complicated and are decided by many factors
70
 We should look at problems from different aspects, not from just one
69
 Only those who are subjective, one-sided and superficial in their approach to problems will smugly issue orders or directives the moment they arrive on the scene, without considering the circumstances, without viewing things in their totality (their history and their present state as a whole) and without getting to the essence of things (their nature and the internal relations between one thing and another)
411
 Such people are bound to trip and fall
39
 "On Practice
13
 In studying a problem, we must shun subjectivity, one-sidedness and superficiality
83
 To be subjective means not to look at problems objectively, that is, not to use the materialist viewpoint in looking at problems
129
 I have discussed this in my essay "On Practice"
48
 To be one-sided means not to look at problems all-sidedly
58
  Or it may be called seeing the part but not the whole, seeing the trees but not the forest
92
 When Sun Wu Tzu said in discussing military science, "Know the enemy and know yourself, and you can fight a hundred battles with no danger of defeat", he was referring to the two sides in a battle
197
 Wei Chengi of the Tang Dynasty also understood the error of one-sidedness when he said, "Listen to both sides and you will be enlightened, heed only one side and you will be benighted
184
" But our comrades often look at problems one-sidedly, and so they often run into snags
87
  Lenin said:    in order really to know an object we must embrace, study, all its sides,  all connections and "mediations"
123
 We shall never achieve this completely,  but the demand for all-sidedness is a safeguard against mistakes and rigidity
119
 We should remember his words
29
 To be superficial means to consider neither the characteristics of a contradiction in its totality nor the characteristics of each of its aspects; it means to deny the necessity for probing deeply into a thing and minutely studying the characteristics of its contradiction, but instead merely to look from afar and, after glimpsing the rough outline, immediately to try to resolve the contradiction (to answer a question, settle a dispute, handle work, or direct a military operation)
485
 This way of doing things is bound to lead to trouble
53
  To be one-sided and superficial is at the same time to be subjective
70
 For all objective things are actually interconnected and are governed by inner laws, but instead of undertaking the task of reflecting things as they really are some people only look at things one-sidedly or superficially and who know neither their interconnections nor their inner laws, and so their method is subjectivist
324
 One-sidedness means thinking in terms of absolutes, that is, a metaphysical approach to problems
97
 In the appraisal of our work, it is one-sided to regard everything either as all positive or as all negative
109
  To regard everything as positive is to see only the good and not the bad, and to tolerate only praise and no criticism
120
 To talk as though our work is good in every respect is at variance with the facts
82
 It is not true that everything is good; there are still shortcomings and mistakes
82
 But neither is it true that everything is bad, and that, too, is at variance with the facts
92
 Here analysis is necessary
27
 To negate everything is to think, without having made any analysis, that nothing has been done well and that the great work of socialist construction, the great struggle in which hundreds of millions of people are participating, is a complete mess with nothing in it worth commending
284
 Although there is a difference between the many people who hold such views and those who are hostile to the socialist system, these views are very mistaken and harmful and can only dishearten people
199
 It is wrong to appraise our work either from the viewpoint that everything is positive, or from the viewpoint that everything is negative
138
 In approaching a problem a Marxist should see the whole as well as the parts
77
 A frog in a well says, "The sky is no bigger than the mouth of the well
72
" That is untrue, for the sky is not just the size of the mouth of the well
75
 If it said, "A part of the sky is the size of the mouth of a well" that would be true, for it tallies with the facts
117
 We must learn to look at problems all-sidedly, seeing the reverse as well as the obverse side of things
104
 In given conditions, a bad thing can lead to good results and good thing to bad results
88
 On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
94
 While we recognize that in the general development of history the material determines the mental and social being determines social consciousness, we also--and indeed must--recognize the reaction of mental on material things, of social consciousness on social being and of the superstructure on the economic base
313
 This does not go against materialism; on the contrary, it avoids mechanical materialism and firmly upholds dialectical materialism
131
 In seeking victory, those who direct a war cannot overstep the limitations imposed by the objective conditions; within these limitations, however, they can and must play a dynamic role in striving for victory
209
 The stage of action for commanders in a war must be built upon objective possibilities, but on that stage they can direct the performance of many a drama, full of sound and colour, power and grandeur
200
 People must adapt their thinking to the changed conditions
59
 Of course no one should go off into wild flights of fancy, or make plans of action unwarranted by the objective situation, or stretch for the impossible
153
 The problem today, however, is that Rightist conservative thinking is still causing mischief in many spheres and preventing the work in these spheres from keeping pace with the development of the objective situation
216
 The present problem is that many people consider it impossible to accomplish things which could be accomplished if they exerted themselves
139
 We should always use our brains and think everything over carefully
68
 A common saying goes, "Knit the brows and you will hit upon a stratagem
72
" In other words, much thinking yields wisdom
45

 If in any process there are a number of contradictions, one of them must be the principal contradiction playing the leading and decisive role, while the rest occupy a secondary and subordinate position
202
 Therefore, in studying any complex process in which there are two or more contradictions, we must devote every effort to funding its principal contradiction
157
 Once this principal contradiction is grasped, all problems can be readily solved
81
 Of the two contradictory aspects, one must be principal and the other secondary
80
 The principal aspect is the one playing the leading role in the contradiction
78
 The nature of a thing is determined mainly by the principal aspect of a contradiction, the aspect which has gained the dominant position
137
 But this situation is not static; the principal and the non-principal aspects of a contradiction transform themselves into each other and the nature of the thing changes accordingly
182
 It is not enough to set tasks, we must also solve the problem of the methods for carrying them out
99
 If our task is to cross a river, we cannot cross it without a bridge or a boat
79
 Unless the bridge or boat problem is solved, it is idle to speak of crossing the river
87
 Unless the problem of method is solved, talk about the task is useless
71
 In any task, if no general and widespread call is issued, the broad masses cannot be mobilized for action
106
 But if persons in leading positions confine themselves to a general call--if they do not personally, in some of the organizations, go deeply and concretely into the work called for, make a break-through at some single point, gain experience and use this experience for guiding other units--then they will have no way of testing the correctness or of enriching the content of their general call, and there is the danger that nothing may come of it
447
 No one in a leading position is competent to give general guidance to all the units unless he derives concrete experience from particular individuals and events in particular subordinate units
193
 This method must be promoted everywhere so that leading cadres at all levels learn to apply it
95
 In any given place, there cannot be a number of central tasks at the same time
79
 At any one time there can be only one central task, supplemented by other tasks of a second or third order of importance
121
 Consequently, the person with over-all responsibility in the locality must take into account the history and circumstances of the struggle there and put the different tasks in their proper order; he should not act upon each instruction as it comes from the higher organization without any planning of his own, and thereby create a multitude of "central tasks" and a state of confusion and disorder
398
 Nor should a higher organization simultaneously assign many tasks to a lower organization without indicating their relative importance and urgency or without specifying which is central, for that will lead to confusion in the steps to be taken by the lower organizations in their work and thus no definite results will be achieved
331
 It is part of the art of leadership to take the whole situation into account and plan accordingly in the light of the historical conditions and existing circumstances of each locality, decide correctly on the centre of gravity and the sequence of the work for each period, steadfastly carry through the decision, and make sure that definite results are achieved
362
 Waiting leads to great loss, while correcting mistakes as soon as they occur reduces loss
90
 Don't wait until problems pile up and cause a lot of trouble before trying to solve them
89
 Leaders must march ahead of the movement, not lag behind it
60
 What we need is an enthusiatic but calm state of mind and intense but orderly work
83
 Everyone engaged in practical work must investigate conditions at the lower levels
83
 Such investigation is especially necessary for those who know theory but do not know the actual conditions, for otherwise they will not be able to link theory with practice
173
 Although my assertion, "No investigation, no right to speak", has been ridiculed as "narrow empiricism", to this day I do not regret having made it; what is more, I still insist that without investigation there cannot possibly be any right to speak
249
 There are many people who "the moment they alight from the official carriage" make a hullabaloo, spout opinions, criticize this and condemn that; but, in fact, ten out of ten of them will meet with failure
206
 For such views or criticisms, which are not based on thorough investigation, are nothing but ignorant twaddle
110
 Stalin rightly says that "theory becomes purposeless if it is not connected with revolutionary practice"
105
 And he rightly adds that "practice gropes in the dark if its path is not illumined by revolutionary theory"
108
 Nobody should be labelled a "narrow empiricist" except the "practical man" who gropes in the dark and lacks perspective and foresight
134
 To take such an attitude is to seek truth from facts
53
 "Facts" are all the things that exist objectively, "truth" means their internal relations, that is, the laws governing them, and "to seek" means to study
154
 We should proceed from the actual conditions inside and outside the country, the province, county or district, and derive from them, as our guide to action, laws which are inherent in them and not imaginary, that is, we should find the internal relations of the events occurring around us
289
 And in order to do that we must rely not on subjective imagination, not on momentary enthusiasm, not on lifeless books, but on facts that exist objectively; we must appropriate the material in detail and, guided by the general principles of Marxism-Leninism, draw correct conclusions from it
292
 III, pp
8
 Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin have taught us that it is necessary to study conditions conscientiously and to proceed from objective reality and not from subjective wishes; but many of our comrades act in direct violation of this truth
236
 You can't solve a problem? Well, get down and investigate the present facts and its past history! When you have investigated the problem thoroughly, you will know how to solve it
179
 Conclusions invariably come after investigation, and not before
64
 Only a block-head cudgels his brains on his own, or together with a group, to "find a soltuion" or "evolve an idea" without making any investigation
149
 It must be stressed that this cannot possibly lead to any effective solution or any good idea
94
 Oppose Book Worship (May 1930), 1st pocked ed
46
 Investigation may be likened to the long months of pregnancy, and solving a problem to the day of birth
104
 To investigate a problem is, indeed to solve it
48
 [With the Marxist-Leninist attitude,] a person applies the theory and method of Marxism-Leninism to the systematic and thorough investigation and study of the environment
171
 He does not work by enthusiasm alone but, as Stalin says, combines revolutionary sweep with practicalness
106
 The only way to know conditions is to make social investigations, to investigate the conditions of each social class in real life
130
 For those charged with directing work, the basic method for knowing conditions is to concentrate on a few cities and villages according to a plan, use the fundamental viewpoint of Marxism, ie, the method of class analysis, and make a number of thorough investigations
268
 A fact-finding meeting need not be large; from three to five or seven or eight people are enough
97
 Ample time must be allowed and an outline for the investigation must be prepared; furthermore, one must personally ask questions, take notes and have discussions with those at the meeting
188
 Therefore one certainly cannot make an investigation, or do it well, without zeal, a determination to direct one's eyes downward and a thirst for knowledge, and without shedding the ugly mantle of pretentiousness and becoming a willing pupil
242
 A commander's correct dispositions stem from his correct decisions, his correct decisions stem from his correct judgements, and his correct judgements stem from a thorough and necessary reconnaissance and from pondering on and piecing together the data of various kinds gathered through reconnaissance
302
 He applies all possible and necessary methods of reconnaissance, and ponders on the information gathered about the enemy's situation, discarding the dross and selecting the essential, eliminating the false and retaining the true, proceeding from the one to the other and from the outside to the inside; then, he takes the conditions on his own side into account, and makes a study of both sides and their interrelations, thereby forming his judgements, making up his mind and working out his plans
498
 Such is the complete process of knowing a situation which a military man goes through before he formulates a strategic plan, a campaign plan or a battle plan
158
 Even if we achieve gigantic successes in our work, there is no reason whatsoever to feel conceited and arrogant
112
 Modesty helps one to go forward, whereas conceit makes one lag behind
70
 This is a truth we must always bear in mind
44
 With victory, the people will be grateful to us and the bourgeoisie will come forward to flatter us
100
 It has been proved that the enemy cannot conquer us by force of arms
69
 However, the flattery of the bourgeoisie may conquer the weak-willed in our ranks
82
 There may be some Communists, who were not conquered by enemies with guns and were worthy of the name of heroes for standing up to these enemies, but who cannot withstand sugar-coated bullets; they will be defeated by sugar-coated bullets
239
 We must guard against such a situation
39
 Many things may become baggage, may become encumbrances, if we cling to them blindly and uncritically
102
 Let us take some illustrations
31
 Having made mistakes, you may feel that, come what may, you are saddled with them and so become dispirited if you have not made mistakes, you may feel that you are free from error and so become conceited
204
 Lack of achievement in work may breed pessimism and depression, while achievement may breed pride and arrogance
112
 A comrade with a short record of struggle may shirk responsibility on this account, while a veteran may become opinionated because of his long record of struggle
162
 Worker and peasant comrades, because of pride in their class origin, may look down upon intellectuals, while intellectuals, because they have a certain amount of knowledge, may look down upon workers and peasants
213
 Any specialized skill may be capitalized on and so may lead to arrogance and contempt of others
96
 Even one's age may become ground for conceit
45
 The young, because they are bright and capable, may look down upon the old; and the old, because they are rich in experience, may look down upon the young
155
 All such things become encumbrances or baggage if there is no critical awareness
81
  the army must endeavour to eradicate such faults
50
 Hard work is like a load placed before us, challenging us to shoulder it
73
 Some loads are light, some heavy

 Some people prefer the light to the heavy; they pick the light and leave the heavy to others
93
 That is not a good attitude
28
 Some comrades are different; they leave ease and comfort to others and carry the heavy loads themselves; they are the first to bear hardships, the last to enjoy comforts
170
 They are good comrades
23
 We should all learn from their communist spirit
48
 There are not a few people who are irresponsible in their work, preferring the light to the heavy, shoving the heavy loads on to others and choosing the easy ones for themselves
178
 At every turn they think of themselves before others
53
 When they make some small contribution, they swell with pride and brag about it for fear that others will not know
115
 They feel no warmth towards comrades and the people but are cold, indifferent and apathetic
92
 In truth such people are not Communists, or at least cannot be counted as true Communists
90
 What are these people after? They are after fame and position and want to be in the limelight
94
 Whenever they are put in charge of a branch of work, they assert their "independence"
86
 It is their dishonesty that causes them to come to grief
57
 I believe we should do things honestly, for without an honest attitude it is absolutely impossible to accomplish anything in this world
136
 They [Communists] must grasp the principle of subordinating the needs of the part to the needs of the whole
108
 If a proposal appears feasible for a partial situation but not for the situation as a whole, then the part must give way to the whole
134
 Conversely, if the proposal is not feasible for the part but is feasible in the light of the situation as a whole, again the part must give way to the whole
157
 This is what is meant by considering the situation as a whole
62
 Pleasure-seeking
17
 In the Red Army there are also quite a few people whose individualism finds expression in pleasure-seeking
107
 They always hope that their unit will march into big cities
60
 They want to go there not to work but to enjoy themselves
58
 The last thing they want is to work in the Red areas where life is hard
72
 We must oppose the tendency towards selfish departmentalism by which the interests of one's own unit are looked after to the exclusion of those of others
154
 Whoever is indifferent to the difficulties of others, refuses to transfer cadres to other units on request, or releases only the inferior ones, "using the neighbour's field as an outlet for his overflow", and does not give the slightest consideration to other departments, localities or people--such a person is a selfish departmentalist who has entirely lost the spirit of communism
384
 Lack of consideration for the whole and complete indifference to other departments, localities and people are characteristics of a selfish departmentalist
155
 We must intensify our efforts to educate such persons and to make them understand that selfish departmentalism is a sectarian tendency which will become very dangerous, if allowed to develop
191
 Liberalism manifests itself in various ways
44
 To let things slide for the sake of peace and friendship when a person has clearly gone wrong, and refrain from principled argument because he is an old acquaintance, a fellow townsman, a schoolmate, a close friend, a loved one, an old colleague or old subordinate
265
 Or to touch on the matter lightly instead of going into it thoroughly, so as to keep on good terms
99
 The result is that both the organization and the individual are harmed
71
 This is one type of liberalism
31
 To indulge in irresponsible criticism in private instead of actively putting forward one's suggestions to the organization
123
 To say nothing to people to their faces but to gossip behind their backs, or to say nothing at a meeting but to gossip afterwards
130
 To show no regard at all for the principles of collective life but to follow one's own inclination
99
 This is a second type
22
 To let things drift if they do not affect one personally; to say as little as possible while knowing perfectly well what is wrong, to be worldly wise and play safe and seek only to avoid blame
193
 This is a third type
21
 Not to obey orders but to give pride of place to one's own opinions
68
 To demand special consideration from the organization but to reject its discipline
83
 This is a fourth type
22
 To indulge in personal attacks, pick quarrels, vent personal spite or seek revenge instead of entering into an argument and struggling against incorrect views for the sake of unity or progress or getting the work done properly
227
 This is a fifth type
21
 To hear incorrect views without rebutting them and even to hear counter-revolutionary remarks without reporting them, but instead to take them calmly as if nothing had happened
177
 This is a sixth type
21
 To be among the masses and fail to conduct propaganda and agitation or speak at meetings or conduct investigations and inquiries among them, and instead to be indifferent to them and show no concern for their well-being, forgetting that one is a Communist and behaving as if one were an ordinary non-Communist
310
 This is a seventh type
23
 To see someone harming the interests of the masses and yet not feel indignant, or dissuade or stop him or reason with him, but to allow him to continue
152
 This is an eighth type
23
 To work half-heartedly without a definite plan or direction; to work perfunctorily and muddle along--"So long as one remains a monk, one goes on tolling the bell
162
" This is a ninth type
22
 To regard oneself as having rendered great service to the revolution, to pride oneself on being a veteran, to disdain minor assignments while being quite unequal to major tasks, to be slipshod in work and slack in study
220
 This is a tenth type
21
 To be aware of one's own mistakes and yet make no attempt to correct them, taking a liberal attitude towards oneself
117
 This is an eleventh type
25
 Liberalism is extremely harmful in a revolutionary collective
62
 It is a corrosive which eats away unity, undermines cohesion, causes apathy and creates dissension
99
 It is an extremely bad tendency
32
 People who are liberals look upon the principles of Marxism as abstract dogma
78
 They approve of Marxism, but are not prepared to practice it or to practice it in full; they are not prepared to replace their liberalism by Marxism
149
 These people have their Marxism, but they have their liberalism as well--they talk Marxism but practice liberalism; they apply Marxism to others but liberalism to themselves
174
 They keep both kinds of goods in stock and find a use for each
63
 This is how the minds of certain people work
45
 The people's state protects the people
39
 Only when the people have such a state can they educate and remould themselves by democratic methods on a country-wide scale, with everyone taking part, and shake off the influence of domestic and foreign reactionaries (which is still very strong, will survive for a long time and cannot be quickly destroyed), rid themselves of the bad habits and ideas acquired in the old society, not allow themselves to be led astray by the reactionaries, and continue to advance -- to advance towards a socialist and communist society
523
 It is not hard for one to do a bit of good
43
 What is hard is to do good all one's life and never do anything bad, to act consistently in the interests of the broad masses, the young people and the revolution, and to engage in arduous struggle for decades on end
217
 The unification of our country, the unity of our people and the unity of our various nationalities -- these are the basic guarantees for the sure triumph of our cause
167
 On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
94
 To elaborate, that means starting from the desire for unity, resolving contradictions through criticism or struggle, and arriving at a new unity on a new basis
160
 In our experience this is the correct method of resolving contradictions among the people
90
 On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
94
 This [our] army has achieved remarkable unity in its own ranks and with those outside its ranks
96
 Internally, there is unity between officers and men, between the higher and lower ranks, and between military work, political work and rear service work, and externally, there is unity between the army and the people, between the army and government organizations, and between our army and the friendly armies
310
 It is imperative to overcome anything that impairs this unity
62
 Within the ranks of the people, democracy is correlative with centralism and freedom with discipline
101
 They are the two opposites of a single entity, contradictory as well as united, and we should not one-sidedly emphasize one to the denial of the other
151
 Within the ranks of the people, we cannot do without freedom, nor can we do without discipline; we cannot do without democracy, nor can we do without centralism
161
 This unity of democracy and centralism, of freedom and discipline, constitutes our democratic centralism
105
 Under this system, the people enjoy broad democracy and freedom, but at the same time they have to keep within the bounds of socialist discipline

 If the view of the minority has been rejected, it must support the decision passed by the majority
99
 If necessary, it can bring up the maker for reconsideration at the next meeting, but apart from that it must not act against the decision in any way
149
 The Three Main Rules of Discipline are as follows:   (1) Obey orders in all your actions
89
  (2) Don't take a single needle or piece of thread from the masses
67
  (3) Turn in everything captured
33
 The Eight Points for Attention are as follows:   (1) Speak politely
68
  (2) Pay fairly for what you buy
33
  (3) Return everything you borrow
34
  (4) Pay for anything you damage
33
  (5) Do not hit or swear at people
35
  (6) Do not damage crops
25
  (7) Do not take liberties with women
38
  (8) Do not ill-treat captives
31
 They [all officers and soldiers of our army] must heighten their sense of discipline and resolutely carry out orders, carry out policy, carry out the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention -- with army and people united, army and government united, officers and soldiers united, and the whole army united -- and permit no breach of discipline
370
 Thoroughgoing materialists are fearless; we hope that all our fellow fighters will courageously shoulder their responsibilities and overcome all difficulties, fearing no setbacks or gibes, nor hesitating to criticize us Communists and give us their suggestions
261
 "He who is not afraid of death by a thousand cuts dares to unhorse the emperor" -- this is the dauntless spirit needed in our struggle to build socialism and communism
168
 We have the Marxist-Leninist weapon of criticism and self-criticism
68
 We can get rid of a bad style and keep the good
48
 As we say, dust will accumulate if a room is not cleaned regularly, our faces will get dirty if they are not washed regularly
126
 The proverb "Running water is never stale and a door-hinge is never worm-eaten" means that constant motion prevents the inroads of germs and other organisms
157
 III, pp
8
 Every Communist and revolutionary should take up this weapon
61
 The mistakes of the past must be exposed without sparing anyone's sensibilities; it is necessary to analyse and criticize what was bad in the past with a scientific attitude so that work in the future will be done more carefully and done better
245
 This is what is meant by "learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones"
73
 But our aim in exposing errors and criticizing shortcomings, like that of a doctor curing a sickness, is solely to save the patient and not to doctor him to death
163
 A person with appendicitis is saved when the surgeon removes his appendix
74
 So long as a person who has made mistakes does not hide his sickness for fear of treatment or persist in his mistakes until he is beyond cure, so long as he honestly and sincerely wishes to be cured and to mend his ways, we should welcome him and cure his sickness so that he can become a good comrade
302
 We can never succeed if we just let ourselves go, and lash out at him
70
 In treating an ideological or a political malady, one must never be rough and rash but must adopt the approach of "curing the sickness to save the patient", which is the only correct and effective method
204
 They do not understand that the main task of criticism is to point out political and organizational mistakes
109
 As to personal shortcomings, unless they are related to political and organizational mistakes, there is no need to be overcritical and to embarrass the comrades concerned
171
 This is a manifestation of petty-bourgeois individualism
57
 If we have shortcomings, we are not afraid to have them pointed out and criticized, because we serve the people
112
 Anyone, no matter who, may point out our shortcomings
54
 If he is right, we will correct them
37
 If what he proposes will benefit the people, we will act upon it
65
 We must not be complacent over any success
43
 We should check our complacency and constantly criticize our shortcomings, just as we should wash our faces or sweep the floor every day to remove the dirt and keep them clean
176
 As for criticism, do it in good time; don't get into the habit of criticizing only after the event
99
 On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation (July 31, 1955), 3rd ed
69
 Taught by mistakes and setbacks, we have become wiser and handle our affairs better
84
 It is hard for any political party or person to avoid mistakes, but we should make as few as possible
102
 Once a mistake is made, we should correct it, and the more quickly and thoroughly the better
93
 Only thus can he be considered a Communist
43
 Every comrade must be brought to understand that the supreme test of the words and deeds of a Communist is whether they conform with the highest interests and enjoy the support of the overwhelming majority of the people
220
 III, pp
8
 At no time and in no circumstances should a Communist place his personal interests first; he should subordinate them to the interests of the nation and of the masses
166
 Hence, selfishness, slacking, corruption, seeking the limelight, and so on, are most contemptible, while selflessness, working with all one's energy, whole-hearted devotion to public duty, and quiet hard work will command respect
230
 Communists must be ready at all times to stand up for the truth, because truth is in the interests of the people; Communists must be ready at all times to correct their mistakes, because mistakes are against the interests of the people
236
 III, pp
8
 Communists must always go into the whys and wherefores of anything, use their own heads and carefully think over whether or not it corresponds to reality and is really well founded; on no account should they follow blindly and encourage slavishness
249
 III, pp
8
 We should encourage comrades to take the interests of the whole into account
77
 Communists should set an example in being practical as well as far-sighted
75
 For only by being practical can they fulfil the appointed tasks, and only far-sightedness can prevent them from losing their bearings in the march forward
155
 Communists should be the most far-sighted, the most self-sacrificing, the most resolute, and the least prejudiced in sizing up situations, and should rely on the majority of the masses and win their support
207
 Communists should therefore set an example in study; at all times they should be pupils of the masses as well as their teachers
128
 Every Communist working in the mass movements should be a friend of the masses and not a boss over them, an indefatigable teacher and not a bureacratic politician
163
 Communists must never separate themselves from the majority of the people or neglect them by leading only a few progressive contingents in an isolated and rash advance, but must take care to forge close links between the progressive elements and the broad masses
263
 This is what is meant by thinking in terms of the majority
59
 We Communists are like seeds and the people are like the soil
62
 Wherever we go, we must unite with the people, take root and blossom among them
80
 We Communists must be able to integrate ourselves with the masses in all things
80
 We Communists ought to face the world and brave the storm, the great world of mass struggle and the mighty storm of mass struggle
130
 The exemplary vanguard role of the Communists is of vital importance
69
 Communists in the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies should set an example in fighting bravely, carrying out orders, observing discipline, doing political work and fostering internal unity and solidarity
204
 A Communist must never be opinionated or domineering, thinking that he is good in everything while others are good in nothing; he must never shut himself up in his little room, or brag and boast and lord it over others
219
 If what they say is right, we ought to welcome it, and we should learn from their strong points; if it is wrong, we should let them finish what they are saying and then patiently explain things to them
202
 The attitude of Communists towards any person who has made mistakes in his work should be one of persuasion in order to help him change and start afresh and not one of exclusion, unless he is incorrigible
205
 As for people who are politically backward, Communists should not slight or despise them, but should befriend them, unite with them, convince them and encourage them to go forward
180
 It is a question of fundamental importance to the proletarian revolutionary cause for a hundred, a thousand, nay ten thousand years
132
 We must shatter these imperialist prophecies
45
 From our highest organizations down to the grass-roots, we must everywhere give constant attention to the training and upbringing of successors to the revolutionary cause
171
 They must be genuine Marxist-Leninists and not revisionists like Khrushchov wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism
114
 They must be proletarian statesmen capable of uniting and working together with the overwhelming majority
106
 Not only must they unite with those who agree with them, they must also be good at uniting with those who disagree and even with those who formerly opposed them and have since been proved wrong
194
 They must be modest and prudent and guard against arrogance and impetuosity; they must be imbued with the spirit of self-criticism and have the courage to correct mistakes and shortcomings in their work
203
 They must not cover up their errors like Khrushchov, and claim all the credit for themselves and shift all the blame on others
127
 Successors to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat come forward in mass struggles and are tempered in the great storms of revolution
139
 It is essential to test and know cadres and choose and train successors in the long course of mass struggle
108
 Cadres are a decisive factor, once the political line is determined
68
 Therefore, it is our fighting task to train large numbers of new cadres in a planned way
89
 This is what "appointing people on their merit" means
54
 It is necessary to maintain the system of cadre participation in collective productive labour
94
 By taking part in collective productive labour, the cadres maintain extensive, constant and close ties with the working people
127
 This is a major measure of fundamental importance for a socialist system; it helps to overcome bureaucracy and to prevent revisionism and dogmatism
148
 We must know how to judge cadres
33
 We must not confine our judgement to a short period or a single incident in a cadre's life, but should consider his life and work as a whole
141
 This is the principal method of judging cadres
47
 We must know how to use cadres well
36
 In the final analysis, leadership involves two main responsibilities: to work out ideas, and to use cadres well
112
 Such things as drawing up plans, making decisions, and giving orders and directives, are all in the category of "working out ideas"
132
 To put the ideas into practice, we must weld the cadres together and encourage them to go into action; this comes into the category of "using the cadres well"
159
 We must know how to take good care of cadres
45
 There are several ways of doing so
35
   First, give them guidance
28
    Second, raise their level
29
 This means educating them by giving them the  opportunity to study so that they can enhance their theoretical understanding  and their working ability
151
    Third, check up on their work, and help them sum up their experience, carry  forward their achievements and correct their mistakes
134
 To assign work without  checking up and to take notice only when serious mistakes are made--that  is not the way to take care of cadres
136
    Fourth, in general, use the method of persuasion with cadres who have made  mistakes, and help them correct their mistakes
126
 The method of struggle should  be confined to those who make serious mistakes and nevertheless refuse to  accept guidance
122
 Here patience is essential
27
 It is wrong lightly to label  people "opportunists" or lightly to begin "waging struggles" against them
104
    Fifth, help them with their difficulties
44
 When cadres are in difficulty as  a result of illness, straitened means or domestic or other troubles, we must  be sure to give them as much care as possible
158
  Second, raise their level
27
 This means educating them by giving them the  opportunity to study so that they can enhance their theoretical understanding  and their working ability
151
  Third, check up on their work, and help them sum up their experience, carry  forward their achievements and correct their mistakes
132
 To assign work without  checking up and to take notice only when serious mistakes are made--that  is not the way to take care of cadres
136
  Fourth, in general, use the method of persuasion with cadres who have made  mistakes, and help them correct their mistakes
124
 The method of struggle should  be confined to those who make serious mistakes and nevertheless refuse to  accept guidance
122
 Here patience is essential
27
 It is wrong lightly to label  people "opportunists" or lightly to begin "waging struggles" against them
104
  Fifth, help them with their difficulties
42
 When cadres are in difficulty as  a result of illness, straitened means or domestic or other troubles, we must  be sure to give them as much care as possible
158
 This is how to take good care of cadres
40
 A leading group that is genuinely united and linked with the masses can gradually be formed only in the process of mass struggle, and not in isolation from it
159
 In the process of a great struggle, the composition of the leading group in most cases should not and cannot remain entirely unchanged throughout the initial, middle and final stages; the activists who come forward in the course of the struggle must constantly be promoted to replace those original members of the leading group who are inferior by comparison or who have degenerated
383
 All old cadres, therefore, should welcome the new ones with the utmost enthusiasm and show them the warmest solicitude
119
 True, new cadres have their shortcomings
41
 They have not been long in the revolution and lack experience, and unavoidably some have brought with them vestiges of the unwholesome ideology of the old society, remnants of the ideology of petty-bourgeois individualism
222
 But such shortcomings can be gradually eliminated through education and tempering in the revolution
100
 The strong point of the new cadres, as Stalin has said, is that they are acutely sensitive to what is new and are therefore enthusiastic and active to a high degree--the very qualities which some of the old cadres lack
219
 Cadres, new and old, should respect each other, learn from each other and overcome their own shortcomings by learning from each other's strong points, so as to unite as one in the common cause and guard against sectarian tendencies
232
 The world is yours, as well as ours, but in the last analysis, it is yours
75
 You young people, full of vigour and vitality, are in the bloom of life, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning
118
 Our hope is placed on you
26
  The world belongs to you
26
 The establishment of our socialist system has opened the road leading to the ideal society of the future, but to translate this ideal into reality needs hard work
163
 On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed
94
 That is why we must constantly carry on lively and effective political education among the masses and should always tell them the truth about the difficulties that crop up and discuss with them how to surmount these difficulties
229
 The young people are the most active and vital force in society
64
 They are the most eager to learn and the least conservative in their thinking
78
 This is especially so in the era of socialism
46
 Of course, the young people should learn from the old and other adults, and should strive as much as possible to engage in all sorts of useful activities with their agreement
175
 How should we judge whether a youth is a revolutionary? How can we tell? There can only be one criterion, namely, whether or not he is willing to integrate himself with the broad masses of workers and peasants and does so in practice
234
 If he is willing to do so and actually does so, he is a revolutionary; otherwise he is a non-revolutionary or a counter-revolutionary
134
 If today he integrates himself with the masses of workers and peasants, then today he is a revolutionary; if tomorrow he ceases to do so or turns round to oppress the common people, then he becomes a non-revolutionary or a counter-revolutionary
245
 The intellectuals often tend to be subjective and individualistic, impractical in their thinking and irresolute in action until they have thrown themselves heart and soul into mass revolutionary struggles, or made up their minds to serve the interests of the masses and become one with them
291
 Some will drop out of the revolutionary ranks at critical moments and become passive, while a few may even become enemies of the revolution
140
 The intellectuals can overcome their shortcomings only in mass struggles over a long period
92
 Young people have to study and work, but they are at the age of physical growth
80
 Therefore, full attention must be paid both to their work and study and to their recreation, sport and rest
108
  As for women, in addition to being dominated by these three systems of authority, they are also dominated by the men (the authority of the husband)
149
 How the peasants have overthrown the political authority of the landlords in the countryside has been described above
118
 The political authority of the landlords is the backbone of all the other systems of authority
95
 With that overturned, the clan authority, the religious authority and the authority of the husband all begin to totter
119
  As to the authority of the husband, this has always been weaker among the poor peasants because, out of economic necessity, their womenfolk have to do more manual labour than the women of the richer classes and therefore have more say and greater power of decision in family matters
284
 With the increasing bankruptcy of the rural economy in recent years, the basis for men's domination over women has already been undermined
139
 With the rise of the peasant movement, the women in many places have now begun to organize rural women's associations; the opportunity has come for them to lift up their heads, and the authority of the husband is getting shakier every day
239
 In a word, the whole feudal-patriarchal system and ideology is tottering with the growth of the peasants' power
112
 Unite and take part in production and political activity to improve the economic and political status of women
111
 Protect the interests of the youth, women and children--provide assistance to young students who cannot afford to continue their studies, help the youth and women to organize in order to participate on an equal footing in all work useful to the war effort and to social progress, ensure freedom of marriage and equality as between men and women, and give young people and children a useful education 
401
 [In agricultural production] our fundamental task is to adjust the use of labour power in an organized way and to encourage women to do farm work
146
 In order to build a great socialist society, it is of the utmost importance to arouse the broad masses of women to join in productive activity
143
 Men and women must received equal pay for equal work in production
67
 Genuine equality between the sexes can only be realized in the process of the socialist transformation of society as a whole
125
 With the completion of agricultural co-operation, many co-operatives are finding themselves short of labour
108
 It has become necessary to arouse the great mass of women who did not work in the fields before to take their place on the labour front 
137
 This reserve should be tapped in the struggle to build a great socialist society
81
 Enable every woman who can work to take her place on the labour front, under the principle of equal pay for equal work
119
 This should be done as quickly as possible
43
 In the world today all culture, all literature and art belong to definite classes and are geared to definite political lines
125
 There is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake, art that stands above classes or art that is detached from or independent of politics
140
 Proletarian literature and art are part of the whole proletarian revolutionary cause; they are, as Lenin said, cogs and wheels in the whole revolutionary machine
162
 Revolutionary culture is a powerful revolutionary weapon for the broad masses of the people
92
 It prepares the ground ideologically before the revolution comes and is an important, indeed essential, fighting front in the general revolutionary front during the revolution
176
 All our literature and art are for the masses of the people, and in the first place for the workers, peasants and soldiers; they are created for the workers, peasants and soldiers and are for their use
202
 Our literary and art workers must accomplish this task and shift their stand; they must gradually move their feet over to the side of the workers, peasants and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat, through the process of going into their very midst and into the thick of practical struggles and through the process of studying Marxism and society
351
 Only in this way can we have a literature and art that are truly for the workers, peasants and soldiers, a truly proletarian literature and art
144
 [Our purpose is] to ensure that literature and art fit well into the whole revolutionary machine as a component part, that they operate as powerful weapons for uniting and educating the people and for attacking and destroying the enemy, and that they help the people fight the enemy with one heart and one mind
311
 In literary and art criticism there are two criteria, the political and the artistic 
86
 There is the political criterion and there is the artistic criterion; what is the relationship between the two? Politics cannot be equated with art, nor can a general world outlook be equated with a method of artistic creation and criticism
241
 We deny not only that there is an abstract and absolutely unchangeable political criterion, but also that there is an abstract and absolutely unchangeable artistic criterion; each class in every class society has its own political and artistic criteria
253
 But all classes in all class societies invariably put the political criterion first and the artistic criterion second
118
  What we demand is the unity of politics and art, the unity of content and form, the unity of revolutionary political content and the highest possible perfection of artistic form
179
 Works of art which lack artistic quality have no force, however progressive they are politically
97
 Therefore, we oppose both the tendency to produce works of art with a wrong political viewpoint and the tendency towards the "poster and slogan style" which is correct in political viewpoint but lacking in artistic power
221
 On questions of literature and art we must carry on a struggle on two fronts
77
 Letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend is the policy for promoting the progress of the arts and sciences and a flourishing socialist culture in our land
189
 Different forms and styles in art should develop freely and different schools in science should contend freely
111
 We think that it is harmful to the growth of art and science if administrative measures are used to impose one particular style of art or school of thought and to ban another
175
 Questions of right and wrong in the arts and science should be settled through free discussion in artistic and scientific circles and through practical work in these fields
173
 They should not be settled in summary fashion

 An army without culture is a dull-witted army, and a dull-witted army cannot defeat the enemy
94
 So we must be good at learning
31
 Conditions are changing all the time, and to adapt one's thinking to the new conditions, one must study
104
 Even those who have a better grasp of Marxism and are comparatively firm in their proletarian stand have to go on studying, have to absorb what is new and study new problems
174
 We can learn what we did not know
34
 We are not only good at destroying the old world, we are also good at building the new
87
 Now, there are two different attitudes towards learning from others
68
 One is the dogmatic attitude of transplanting everything, whether or not it is suited to our conditions
104
 This is no good
16
 The other attitude is to use our heads and learn those things which suit our conditions, that is, to absorb whatever experience is useful to us
144
 That is the attitude we should adopt

 The theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin is universally applicable
71
 We should regard it not as a dogma, but as a guide to action
61
 Studying it is not merely a matter of learning terms and phrases but of learning Marxism-Leninism as the science of revolution
127
 It is not just a matter of understanding the general laws derived by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin from their extensive study of real life and revolutionary experience, but of studying their standpoint and method in examining and solving problems
248
 If we have a correct theory but merely prate about it, pigeonhole it and do not put it into practice, then that theory, however good, is of no significance
156
 It is necessary to master Marxist theory and apply it, master it for the sole purpose of applying it
101
 If you can apply the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint in elucidating one or two practical problems, you should be commended and credited with some achievement
153
 The more problems you elucidate and the more comprehensively and profoundly you do so, the greater will be your achievement
124
 Some comrades, however, are "shooting without a target", shooting at random, and such people are liable to harm the revolution
127
 Those experienced in work must take up the study of theory and must read seriously; only then will they be able to systematize and synthesize their experience and raise it to the level of theory, only then will they not mistake their partial experience for universal truth and not commit empiricist errors
306
 Reading is learning, but applying is also learning and the more important kind of learning at that
99
 Our chief method is to learn warfare through warfare
53
 A person who has had no opportunity to go to school can also learn warfare--he can learn through fighting in war
113
 A revolutionary war is a mass undertaking, it is often n a matter of first learning and then doing, but of doing and the learning, for doing is itself learning
160
 There is a gap between the ordinary civilian and the soldier, but it is no Great Wall, and it can be quickly closed, and the way to close it is to take part in revolution in war
178
 By saying that it is not easy to learn and to apply, we mean that It Is hard to learn thoroughly and to apply skillfully
121
 By saying that civilians can very quickly become soldiers, we mean that it is not difficult to cross the threshold
115
" To cross the threshold is not difficult and mastery, too, is possible provided one sets one's mind to the task and is good at learning
136
 We must learn to do economic work from all who know how, no matter who they are
80
 We must esteem them as teachers, learning from them respectfully and conscientiously
85
 We must not pretend to know when we do not know
48
 Knowledge is a matter of science, and no dishonesty or conceit whatsoever is permissible
89
 What is required is definitely the reverse--honesty and modesty
64
 Complacency is the enemy of study
34
 We cannot really learn anything until we rid ourselves of complacency
70
 Our attitude towards ourselves should be "to be insatiable in learning" and towards others "to be tireless in teaching"
120
 Some people have read a few Marxist books and think themselves quite learned, but what they have read has not penetrated, has not struck root in their minds, so that they do not know how to use it and their class feelings remain as of old
239
 Others are very conceited and having learned some book-phrases, they think themselves terrific and are very cocky; but whenever a storm blows up, they take a stand very different from that of the workers and the great majority of the peasants
243
 They waver while the latter stand firm, they equivocate while the latter are forthright
88
 In order to have a real grasp of Marxism, one must learn it not only from books, but chiefly through class struggle, through practical work and close contact with the masses of workers and peasants
198
 When in addition to reading some Marxist books our intellectuals have gained some understanding through close contact with the masses of workers and peasants and through their own practical work, we will all be speaking the same language, not only the common language of patriotism and the common language of the socialist system, but probably even the common language of the communist world outlook
400
 If that happens, all of us will certainly work much better
