According to the Marxist theory of the state, the army is the chief component
of state power. Whoever wants to seize and retain state power must have a
strong army. Some people ridicule us as advocates of the "omnipotence of
war". Yes, we are advocates of the omnipotence of revolutionary war; that
is good, not bad, it is Marxist. The guns of the Russian Communist Party
created socialism. We shall create a democratic republic. Experience in the
class struggle in the era of imperialism teaches us that it is only by the
power of the gun that the working class and the labouring masses can defeat
the armed bourgeoisie and landlords; in this sense we may say that only with
guns can the whole world be transformed.

If there is to be revolution, there must be a revolutionary party. Without

a revolutionary party, without a party built on the Marxist-Leninist

revolutionary theory and in the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary style, it

is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people

to defeat imperialism and its running dogs.

It is an arduous task to ensure a better life for the several hundred million

people of China and to build our economically and culturally backward country

into a prosperous and powerful one with a high level of culture. And it is

precisely in order to be able to shoulder this task more competently and

work better with all non-Party people who are actuated by high ideals and

determined to institute reforms that we must conduct rectification movements

both now and in the future, and constantly rid ourselves of whatever is wrong.

Policy is the starting-point of all the practical actions of a revolutionary

party and manifests itself in the process and the end-result of that party's

actions. A revolutionary party is carrying out a policy whenever it takes

any action. If it is not carrying out a correct policy, it is carrying out

a wrong policy; if it is not carrying out a given policy consciously, it

is doing so blindly. What we call experience is the process and the end-result

of carrying out a policy. Only through the practice of the people, that is,

through experience, can we verify whether a policy is correct or wrong and

determine to what extent it is correct or wrong. But people's practice,

especially the practice of a revolutionary party and the revolutionary masses,

cannot but be related to one policy or another. Therefore, before any action

is taken, we must explain the policy, which we have formulated in the light

of the given circumstances, to Party members and to the masses. Otherwise,

Party members and the masses will depart from the guidance of our policy,

act blindly and carry out a wrong policy.

Our Party has laid down the general line and general policy of the Chinese

revolution as well as various specific lines for work and specific policies.

However, while many comrades remember our Party's specific lines for work

If we actually forget the Party's general line and general policy, then we

shall be blind, half-baked, muddle-headed revolutionaries, and when we carry

out a specific line for work and a specific policy, we shall lose our bearings

and vacillate now to the left and now to the right, and the work will suffer.

Classes struggle, some classes triumph, others are eliminated. Such is history,

<P ALIGN=Left>

Changes in society are due chiefly to the development of the internal

contradictions in society, that is, the contradiction between the productive

forces and the relations of production, the contradiction between classes

and the contradiction between the old and the new; it is the development

of these contradictions that pushes society forward and gives the impetus

for the supersession of the old society by the new.

A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture,

Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of the first

importance for the revolution. The basic reason why all previous revolutionary

struggles in China achieved so little was their failure to unite with real

friends in order to attack real enemies. A revolutionary party is the guide

of the masses, and no revolution ever succeeds when the revolutionary party

leads them astray. To ensure that we will definitely achieve success in our

revolution and will not lead the masses astray, we must pay attention to

uniting with our real friends in order to attack our real enemies. To distinguish

real friends from real enemies, we must make a general analysis of the economic

status of the various classes in Chinese society and of their respective

attitudes towards the revolution.

Our enemies are all those in league with imperialism--the warlords, the

bureaucrats, the comprador class, the big landlord class and the reactionary

section of the intelligentsia attached to them. The leading force in our

revolution is the industrial proletariat. Our closest friends are the entire

semi-proletariat and petty bourgeoisie. As for the vacillating middle

bourgeoisie, their right-wing may become our enemy and their left-wing may

become our friend--but we must be constantly on our guard and not let them

create confusion within our ranks.

I hold that it is bad as far as we are concerned if a person, a political

party, an army or a school is not attacked by the enemy, for in that case

it would definitely mean that we have sunk to the level of the enemy. &nbsp;It

is good if we are attacked by the enemy, since it proves that we have drawn

a clear line of demarcation between the enemy and ourselves. &nbsp;It is

still better if the enemy attacks us wildly and paints us as utterly black

and without a single virtue; it demonstrates that we have not only drawn

a clear line of demarcation between the enemy and ourselves but achieved

a great deal in our work.

In China, although socialist transformation has been completed with respect

to the system of ownership, and although the large-scale, turbulent class

struggles of the masses characteristic of times of revolution have in the

main come to an end, there are still remnants of the overthrown landlord

and comprador classes, there is still a bourgeoisie, and the remoulding of

the petty bourgeoisie has only just started. The class struggle is by no

means over. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie,

the class struggle between the different political forces, and the class

struggle in the ideological field between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie

will continue to be long and tortuous and at times even become very acute.

The proletariat seeks to transform the world according to its own world outlook,

and so does the bourgeoisie. In this respect, the question of which will

win out, socialism or capitalism, is not really settled.

<P ALIGN=Right>

<I>On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People</I> (February

<P ALIGN=Left>

It will take a fairly long period of time to decide the issue in the<STRONG>

</STRONG>ideological struggle between socialism and capitalism in our country.

The reason is that the influence of the bourgeoisie and of the intellectuals

who come from the old society will remain in our country for a long time

to come, the so will their class ideology . If this is not sufficiently

understood, or is not understood at all, the gravest mistakes will be made

and the necessity of waging struggle in the ideological field will be ignored.

<P ALIGN=Right>

<I>Ibid.</I>, pp. 52-53.

<P ALIGN=Left>

In our country bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology, anti-Marxist ideology,

will continue to exist for a long time. Basically, the socialist system has

been established in our country. We have won the basic victory in transforming

the ownership of the means of production, but we have not yet won complete

victory on the political and ideological fronts. In the ideological field,

the question of who will win in the struggle between the proletariat or the

bourgeoisie has not been really settled yet. We still<STRONG> </STRONG>have

to wage a protracted struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology.

It is wrong not to understand this and to give up<STRONG> </STRONG>ideological

struggle. All erroneous ideas, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters,

must be subjected to criticism; in no circumstances<STRONG> </STRONG>should

they be allowed to spread unchecked. However, the criticism should be fully

reasoned, analytical and convincing, and not rough, bureaucratic, metaphysical

or dogmatic.

Both dogmatism and revisionism run counter to Marxism. Marxism must certainly

advance; it must develop along with practice and cannot stand still. It would

become lifeless if it remained stagnant and stereotyped. However, the basic

principles of Marxism must never<STRONG> </STRONG>be violated, otherwise

mistakes will be made. It is dogmatism to approach Marxism from a metaphysical

point of view and to regard<STRONG> </STRONG>it as something rigid. It is

revisionism to negate the basic principles of Marxism and to negate its universal

truth. Revisionism is one form of bourgeois ideology. The revisionists deny

the differences between socialism and capitalism, between the dictatorship

of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. What they advocate

is in fact not the socialist line but the capitalist line. One of our current

important tasks on the ideological front is to unfold criticism of revisionism.

<P ALIGN=Right>

Revisionism, or Right opportunism, is a bourgeois trend of thought that is

even more dangerous than dogmatism. The revisionists, the Right opportunists,

pay lip-service to Marxism; they too attack "dogmatism". But what they are

really attacking is the quintessence of Marxism. They oppose or distort

materialism and dialectics, oppose or try to weaken the people's democratic

dictatorship and the leading role of the Communist Party, and oppose or try

to weaken socialist transformation and socialist construction. After the

basic victory of the socialist revolution in our country, there are still

a number of people who vainly hope to restore the capitalist system and fight

the working class on every front, including the ideological one. And their

right-hand men in this struggle are the revisionists.

</H2>

<P>

Communism is at once a complete system of proletarian ideology and a new

social system. It is different from any other ideology or social system,

and is the most complete, progressive, revolutionary and rational system

in human history. The ideological and social system of feudalism has a place

only in the museum of history. The ideological and social system of capitalism

has also become a museum piece in one part of the world (in the Soviet Union),

while in other countries it resembles "a dying person who is sinking fast,

like the sun setting beyond the western hills", and will soon be relegated

to the museum. The communist ideological and social system alone is full

of youth and vitality, sweeping the world with the momentum of an avalanche

and the force of a thunderbolt.

Taken as a whole, the Chinese revolutionary movement led by the Communist

revolutions, which are two essentially different revolutionary processes,

been completed. The democratic revolution is the necessary preparation for

the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution is the inevitable

sequel to the democratic revolution. The ultimate aim for which all communists

Socialist revolution aims at liberating the productive forces. &nbsp;The

change-over from individual to socialist, collective ownership in agricultural

and handicrafts and from capitalist to socialist ownership in private industry

forces. &nbsp;Thus the social &nbsp;conditions are being created for a tremendous

expansion of industrial and agricultural production.

We are now carrying out a revolution not only in the social system, the change

from private to public ownership, but also in technology, the change from

handicraft to large-scale modern machine production, and the two revolutions

are interconnected. In agriculture, with conditions as they are in our country,

co-operation must precede the use of big machinery (in capitalist countries

agriculture develops in a capitalist way). Therefore we must on no account

regard industry and agriculture, socialist industrialization and the socialist

transformation of agriculture as two separate and isolated things, and on

no account must we emphasize the one and play down the other.

The new social system has only just been established and requires time for

to be consolidated step by step. To achieve its ultimate consolidation, it

is necessary not only to bring about the socialist industrialization of the

country and persevere in the socialist revolution on the economic front,

but also to carry on constant and arduous socialist revolutionary struggles

and socialist education on the political and ideological fronts. Moreover,

various complementary international conditions are required.

In China the struggle to consolidate the socialist system, the struggle to

decide whether socialism or capitalism will prevail, will still take a long

historical period. But we should all realize that the new system of socialism

will unquestionably be consolidated. We can assuredly build a socialist state

with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

<P>

The number of intellectuals who are hostile to our state is very small. They

do not like our state, <I>i.e.</I> the dictatorship of the proletariat, and

yearn for the old society. Whenever there is an opportunity, they will stir

up trouble and attempt to overthrow the Communist Party and restore the old

China. As between the proletarian and the bourgeois roads, as between the

socialist and the capitalist roads, they stubbornly choose to follow the

latter. In fact this road is impossible, and in fact, therefore, they are

ready to capitulate to imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism.

Such persons are found in political circles and in industrial and commercial,

cultural and educational, scientific and technological and religious circles,

and they are extremely reactionary.

The serious problem is the education of the peasantry. The peasant economy

socialization of agriculture, there can be no complete, consolidated socialism.

The leading bodies in co-operatives must establish the dominant position

of the poor peasants and the new lower middle peasants in these bodies, with

the old lower middle peasants and the upper middle peasants--whether old

or new--as the supplementary force. Only thus can unity between the poor

and middle peasants be attained, the co-operatives be consolidated, production

be expanded and the socialist transformation of the entire countryside be

correctly accomplished in accordance with the Party's policy. Otherwise,

unity between the middle and poor peasants cannot be attained, the co-operatives

cannot be consolidated, production cannot be expanded and the socialist

transformation of the entire countryside cannot be achieved.

Introductory note to "How Control of the Wutang Co-operative Shifted from

<P>

It is essential to unite with the middle peasants, and it is wrong not to

do so. But on whom must the working class and the Communist Party rely in

the countryside in order to unite with the middle peasants and realize the

socialist transformation of the entire countryside? Surely on none other

than the poor peasants. That was the case when the struggle against the landlords

was being waged and the land reform was being carried out, and that is the

case today when the struggle against the rich peasants and other capitalist

elements is being waged to achieve the socialist transformation of agriculture.

In both these revolutionary periods, the middle peasants wavered in the initial

stages. It is only after they clearly see the general trend of events and

the approaching triumph of the revolution that the middle peasants will come

in on the side of the revolution. The poor peasants must work on the middle

peasants and win them over, so that the revolution will broaden from clay

to day until final victory.

The agricultural co-operative movement has been a severe ideological and

political struggle from the very beginning. No cooperative can be established

without going through such a struggle. Before a brand-new social system can

be built on the site of the old the site must be swept clean. Invariably,

remnants of old ideas reflecting the old system remain in people's minds

for a long time, and they do not easily give way. After a co-operative is

established, it must go through many more struggles before it can be

consolidated. Even then, the moment it relaxes its efforts it may collapse.

<P>

The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the

countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere

and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On

the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of

sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting

out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the

countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who

lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are

doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties.

Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist

direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their

demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant

alliance continue to stand firm in these circumstances? Obviously not. There

is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring

about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture

simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization

and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and

commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate

the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so

that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We

maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

Our state is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class

and based on the worker-peasant alliance. What is this dictatorship for?

Its first function is to suppress the reactionary classes and elements and

those exploiters in our country who resist the socialist revolution, to suppress

those who try to wreck our socialist construction, or in other words, to

resolve the internal contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. For

instance, to arrest, try and sentence certain counter-revolutionaries, and

to deprive landlords and bureaucrat-capitalists of their right to vote and

their freedom of speech for a specified period of time--all this comes within

the scope of our dictatorship. To maintain public order and safeguard the

interests of the people, it is likewise necessary to exercise dictatorship

over embezzlers, swindlers, arsonists, murderers, criminal gangs and other

scoundrels who seriously disrupt public order. The second function of this

dictatorship is to protect our country from subversion and possible aggression

by external enemies. In that event, it is the task of this dictatorship to

resolve the external contradiction between ourselves and the enemy. The aim

of this dictatorship is to protect all our people so that they can devote

themselves to peaceful labour and build China into a socialist country with

a modern industry, agriculture, science and culture.

Class struggle, the struggle for production and scientific experiment are

the three great revolutionary movements for building a mighty socialist country.

These movements are a sure guarantee that Communists will be free from

bureaucracy and immune against revisionism and dogmatism, and will for ever

remain invincible. They are a reliable guarantee that the proletariat will

be able to unite with the broad working masses and realize a democratic

dictatorship. If, in the absence of these movements, the landlords, rich

peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements and monsters were all allowed

to crawl out, while our cadres were to shut their eyes to all this and in

many cases fail even to differentiate between the enemy and ourselves but

were to collaborate with the enemy and were corrupted, divided and demoralized

by him, if our cadres were thus pulled out or the enemy were able to sneak

in, and if many of our workers, peasants, and intellectuals were left defenceless

against both the soft and the hard tactics of the enemy, then it would not

take long, perhaps only several years or a decade, or several decades at

most, before a counter-revolutionary restoration on a national scale inevitably

occurred, the Marxist-Leninist party would undoubtedly become a revisionist

party or a fascist party, and the whole of China would change its colour.

The people's democratic dictatorship uses two methods. Towards the enemy,

it uses the method of dictatorship, that is, for as long a period of time

as is necessary it does not let them take part in political activities and

compels them to obey the law of the People's Government and to engage in

labour and, through labour, transform themselves into new men. Towards the

people, on the contrary, it uses the method not of compulsion but of democracy,

that is, it must necessarily let them take part in political activities and

does not compel them to do this or that, but uses the method of democracy

</H2>

<P>

We are confronted with two types of social contradictions -- those between

ourselves and the enemy and those among the people themselves. The two are

totally different in their nature.

<P ALIGN=Right>

<I>On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People</I> (February

27, 1957), 1st pocket ed., p. 2.

<P ALIGN=Left>

To understand these two different types of contradictions correctly, we must

first be clear on what is meant by "the people" and what is meant by "the

enemy". &nbsp;. . . At the present stage, the period of building socialism,

the classes, strata and social groups which favour, support and work for

the cause of socialist construction all come within the category of the people,

while the social forces and groups which resist the socialist revolution

and are hostile to or sabotage socialist construction are all enemies of

the people.

<P ALIGN=Right>

<I>Ibid</I>., pp. 2-3.

<P ALIGN=Left>

In the conditions prevailing in China today, the contradictions among the

people comprise the contradictions within the working class, the contradictions

within the peasantry, the contradictions within the intelligentsia, the

contradictions between the working class and the peasantry, the contradictions

between the workers and peasants on the one hand and the intellectuals on

the other, the contradictions between the working class and other sections

of the working people on the one hand and the national bourgeoisie on the

other, the contradictions within the national bourgeoisie, and so on. Our

People's Government is one that genuinely represents the people's interests,

it is a government that serves the people. Nevertheless, there are still

certain contradictions between this government and the people. These include

the contradictions between the interests of the state and the interests of

the collective and the interests of the individual; between democracy and

centralism; between the leadership and the led; and the contradictions arising

from the bureaucratic style of work of certain government workers in their

relations with the masses. All these are also contradictions among the people.

Generally speaking, the people's basic identity of interests underlies the

contradictions among the people.

<P ALIGN=Right>

<I>Ibid</I>., pp. 3-4.

<P ALIGN=Left>

The contradictions between ourselves and the enemy are antagonistic

contradictions. Within the ranks of the people, the contradictions among

the working people are non-antagonistic, while those between the exploited

and the exploiting classes have a non-antagonistic in addition to an antagonistic

aspect.

In the political life of our people, how should right be distinguised from

wrong in one's words and actions? On the basis of the principles of our

Constitution, the will of the overwhelming majority of our people and the

common political positions which have been proclaimed on various occasions

by our political parties and groups, we consider that, broadly speaking,

the criteria should be as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  (1) Words and deeds should help to unite, and not divide, the people of all

  our nationalities.

  <P>

  (2) They should be beneficial, and not harmful, to socialist transformation

  and socialist construction.

  <P>

  (3) They should help to consolidate, and not undermine or weaken, the people's

  democratic dictatorship.

  <P>

  (4) They should help to consolidate, and not undermine or weaken, democratic

  centralism.

  <P>

  (5) They should help to strengthen, and not shake off or weaken, the leadership

  of the Communist Party.

  <P>

  (6) They should be beneficial, and not harmful, to international socialist

  unity and the unity of the peace-loving people of the world.

<P>

Of these six criteria, the most important are the socialist path and the

leadership of the Party.

<P ALIGN=Right>

<I>Ibid</I>., pp. 57-58.

<P>

The question of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is one of a struggle

between ourselves and the enemy, a contradiction between ourselves and the

enemy. Among the people, there are some who see this question in a somewhat

different light. Two kinds of people hold views differing from ours. Those

with a Rightist way of thinking make no distinction between ourselves and

the enemy and take the enemy for our own people. They regard as friends the

very persons whom the masses regard as enemies. Those with a "Left" deviation

in their thinking magnify contradictions between ourselves and the enemy

to such an extent that they take certain contradictions among the people

for contradictions with the enemy and regard as counter-revolutionaries persons

who are actually not counter-revolutionaries. Both these views are wrong.

Neither can lead to the correctly handling of the problem of suppressing

counter-revolutionaries or to a correct assessment of this work.

Qualitatively different contradictions can only be resolved by qualitatively

different methods. For instance, the contradiction between the proletariat

and the bourgeoisie is resolved by the method of socialist revolution; the

contradiction between the great masses of the people and the feudal system

is resolved by the method of democratic revolution; the contradiction between

the colonies and imperialism is resolved by the method of national revolutionary

war; the contradiction between the working class and the peasant class in

socialist society is resolved by the method of collectivization and mechanization

in agriculture; contradiction within the Communist Party is resolved by the

method of criticism and self-criticism; the contradiction between society

and nature is resolved by the method of developing the productive forces.

&nbsp;. . . The principle of using different methods to resolve different

contradictions is one which Marxist-Leninists must strictly observe.

<P>

Since they are different in nature, the contradictions between ourselves

and the enemy and the contradictions among the people must be resolved by

different methods. To put it briefly, the former entail drawing a clear

distinction between ourselves and the enemy, and the latter entail drawing

a clear distinction between right and wrong. It is, of course, true that

the distinction between ourselves and the enemy is also one of right and

wrong. For example, the question of who is in the right, we or the domestic

and foreign reactionaries, the imperialists, the feudalists and

bureaucrat-capitalists, is also a matter of right and wrong, but it is in

a different category from questions of right and wrong among the people.

To be able to carry on their production and studies effectively and to arrange

orders of an obligatory nature. It is common sense that the maintenance of

public order would be impossible without such adminstrative regulations.

Administrative orders and the method of persuasion and education complement

each other in resolving contradictions among the people. Even administrative

regulations for the maintenance of public order must be accompanied by persuasion

and education, for in many cases regulations alone will not work.

Inevitably, the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie will give expression to

their own ideologies. Inevitably, they will stubbornly express themselves

on political and ideological questions by every possible means. You cannot

expect them to do otherwise. We should not use the method of suppression

and prevent them from expressing themselves, but should allow them to do

so and at the same time argue with them and direct appropriate criticism

at them. We must undoubtedly criticize wrong ideas of every description.

It certainly would not be right to refrain from criticism, look on while

wrong ideas spread unchecked and allow them to monopolize the field. Mistakes

must be criticized and poisonous weeds fought wherever they crop up. However,

such criticism should not be dogmatic, and the metaphysical method should

not be used, but instead the effort should be made to apply the dialectical

method. What is needed is scientific analysis and convincing argument.

In ordinary circumstances, contradictions among the people are not antagonistic.

But if they are not handled properly, or if we relax our vigilance and lower

is that the system of exploitation of man by man has been abolished and the

interests of the people are basically the same.

In our country, the contradiction between the working class and the national

bourgeoisie belongs to the category of contradictions among the people. By

and large, the class struggle between the two is a class struggle within

the ranks of the people, because the Chinese national bourgeoisie has a dual

character. In the period of the bourgeois-democratic revolution, it had both

a revolutionary and a conciliationist side to its character. In the period

of the socialist revolution, exploitation of the working class for profit

constitutes one side of the character of the national bourgeoisie, while

its support of the Constitution and its willingness to accept socialist

transformation constitute the other. The national bourgeoisie differs from

the imperialists, the landlords and the bureaucrat-capitalists. The contradiction

between the national bourgeoisie and the working class is one between exploiter

and exploited, and is by nature antagonistic. But in the concrete conditions

of China, this antagonistic contradiction between the two classes, if properly

handled, can be transformed into a non-antagonistic one and be resolved by

peaceful methods. However, it will change into a contradiction between ourselves

and the enemy if we do not handle it properly and do not follow the policy

of uniting with, criticizing and educating the national bourgeoisie, or if

the national bourgeoisie does not accept this policy of ours.

People all over the world are now discussing whether or not a third world

war will break out. On this question, too, we must be mentally prepared and

do some analysis. We stand firmly for peace and against war. But if the

imperialists insist on unleashing another war, we should not be afraid of

it. Our attitude on this question is the same as our attitude towards any

disturbance: first, we are against it; second, we are not afraid of it. The

First World War was followed by the birth of the Soviet Union with a population

of 200 million. The Second World War was followed by the emergence of the

socialist camp with a combined population of 900 million. If the imperialists

insist on launching a third world war, it is certain that several hundred

million more will turn to socialism, and then there will not be much room

left on earth for the imperialists; it is also likely that the whole structure

of imperialism will utterly collapse.

That is certain; they will never neglect these activities. To take another

possible. Furthermore, if they still hanker after adventures, they will send

<P>

Just as there is not a single thing in the world without a dual nature (this

is the law of the unity of opposites), so imperialism and all reactionaries

have a dual nature -- they are real tigers and paper tigers at the same time.

In past history, before they won state power and for some time afterwards,

the slave-owning class, the feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie were

vigorous, revolutionary and progressive; they were real tigers. But with

the lapse of time, because their opposites -- the slave class, the peasant

class and the proletariat -- grew in strength step by step, struggled against

them and became more and more formidable, these ruling classes changed step

by step into the reverse, changed into reactionaries, changed into backward

people, changed into paper tigers. And eventually they were overthrown, or

will be overthrown, by the people. The reactionary, backward, decaying classes

retained this dual nature even in their last life-and-death struggles against

the people. On the one hand, they were real tigers; they ate people, ate

people by the millions and tens of millions. The cause of the people's struggle

went through a period of difficulties and hardships, and along the path there

were many twists and turns. To destroy the rule of imperialism, feudalism

and bureaucrat-capitalism in China took the Chinese people more than a hundred

years and cost them tens of millions of lives before the victory in 1949.

Look! Were these not living tigers, iron tigers, real tigers? But in the

end they changed into paper tigers, dead tigers, bean-curd tigers. These

are historical facts. Have people not seen or heard about these facts? There

have indeed been thousands and tens of thousands of them! Thousands and tens

of thousands! Hence, imperialism and all reactionaries, looked at in essence,

from a long-term point of view, from a strategic point of view, must be seen

for what they are -- paper tigers. On this we should build our strategic

thinking. On the other hand, they are also living tigers, iron tigers, real

tigers which can eat people. On this we should build our tactical thinking.

by imperialism to do so, more than 90 per cent of the people of the world

are rising or will rise up in struggle against it. Yet imperialism is still

alive, still running amuck in Asia, Africa and Latin America. In the West

Speech at the Supreme State Conference (September 8, 1958).

<P>

Over a long period we have developed this concept for the struggle against

the enemy: strategically we should despise all our enemies, but tactically

we should take them all seriously. This also means that we must despise the

enemy with respect to the whole, but that we must take him seriously with

respect to each and every concrete question. If we do not despise the enemy

with respect to the whole, we shall be committing the error of opportunism.

Marx and Engels were only two individuals, and yet in those early days they

already declared that capitalism would be overthrown throughout the world.

But in dealing with concrete problems and particular enemies we shall be

committing the error of adventurism unless we take them seriously. In war,

battles can only be fought one by one and the enemy forces can only be destroyed

one by one. Factories can only be built one by one. The peasants can only

plough the land plot by plot. The same is even true of eating a meal.

Strategically, we take the eating of a meal lightly&#151;we know we can finish

it. But actually we eat it mouthful by mouthful. It is impossible to swallow

an entire banquet in one gulp. This is known as a piecemeal solution. In

military parlance, it is called wiping out the enemy forces one by one.

Unquestionably, victory or defeat in war is determined mainly by the military,

political, economic and natural conditions on both sides. But not by these

alone. It is also determined by each side's subjective ability in directing

the war. In his endeavour to win a war, a military man cannot overstep the

limitations imposed by the material conditions; within these limitations,

however, he can and must strive for victory. The stage of action for a military

man is built upon objective material conditions, but on that stage he i can

direct the performance of many a drama, full of sound and colour, power and

grandeur.

<P ALIGN=Right>

<I>Ibid</I>., pp. 190-91.*

<P>

The object of war is specifically "to preserve oneself and destroy the enemy"

(to destroy the enemy means to disarm him or "deprive him of the power to

resist", and does not mean to destroy every member of his forces physically).

In ancient warfare, the spear and the shield were used, the spear to attack

and destroy the enemy, and the shield to defend and preserve oneself. To

the present day, all weapons are still an extension of the spear and the

shield. The bomber, the machine-gun, the long-range gun and poison gas are

developments of the spear, while the air-raid shelter, the steel helmet,

the concrete fortification and the gas mask are developments of the shield.

The tank is a new weapon combining the functions of both spear and shield.

Attack is the chief means of destroying the enemy, but defence cannot be

dispensed with. In attack the immediate object is to destroy the enemy, but

at the same time it is self-preservation, because if the enemy is not destroyed,

you will be destroyed. In defence the immediate object is to preserve yourself,

but at the same time defence is a means of supplementing attack or preparing

to go over to the attack. Retreat is in the category of defence and is a

continuation of defence, while pursuit is a continuation of attack. It should

be pointed out that destruction of the enemy is the primary object of war

and self-preservation the secondary, because only by destroying the enemy

in large numbers can one effectively preserve oneself. Therefore attack,

the chief means of destroying the enemy, is primary, while defence, a

supplementary means of destroying the enemy and a means of self-preservation,

is secondary. In actual warfare the chief role is played by defence much

of the time and by attack for the rest of the time, but if war is taken as

a whole, attack remains primary.

<P ALIGN=Right>

"On Protracted War" (May 1938), <I>Selected Works</I>, Vol. II, p. 156.

<P>

All the guiding principles of military operations grow out of the one basic

principle: to strive to the utmost to preserve one's own strength and destroy

that of the enemy. In a revolutionary war, this principle is directly linked

with basic political principles. For instance, the basic political principle

of China's War of Resistance Against Japan, <EM>i.e.</EM>, its political

aim, is to drive out Japanese imperialism and build an independent, free

and happy new China. In terms of military action this principle means the

use of armed force to defend our motherland and to drive out the Japanese

invaders. To attain this end, the operations of the armed units take the

form of doing their utmost to preserve their own strength on the one hand

and destroy the enemies on the other. How then do we justify the encouragement

of heroic sacrifice in war? Every war exacts a price, sometimes an extremely

high one. Is this not in contradiction with "preserving oneself"? In fact,

these is no contradiction at all; to put it more exactly; sacrifice and

self-preservation are both opposite and complementary to each other. For

such sacrifice is essential not only for destroying the enemy but also for

preserving oneself--partial and temporary "non-preservation" (sacrifice,

or paying the price) is necessary for the sake of general and permanent

preservation. From this basic principle stems the series of principles guiding

military operations, all of which--from the principles of shooting (taking

cover to preserve oneself, and making full use of fire-power to destroy the

enemy) to the principles of strategy--are permeated with the spirit of this

basic principle. All technical, tactical and strategic principles represent

applications of this basic principle. The principle of preserving oneself

and destroying the enemy is the basis of all military principles.

Our principles of operation are:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  (1) Attack dispersed, isolated enemy forces first; attack concentrated, strong

  enemy forces later.

  <P>

  (2) Take small and medium cities and extensive rural areas first; take big

  cities later.

  <P>

  (3) Make wiping out the enemy's effective strength our main objective; do

  not make holding or seizing a city or place our main objective. Holding or

  seizing a city or place is the outcome of wiping out the enemy's effective

  strength, and often a city or place can be held or seized for good only after

  it has changed hands a number of times.

  <P>

  (4) In every battle, concentrate an absolutely superior force (two, three,

  four and sometimes even five or six times the enemy's strength), encircle

  the enemy forces completely, strive to wipe them out thoroughly and do not

  let any escape from the net. In special circumstances, use the method of

  dealing crushing blows to the enemy, that is, concentrate all our strength

  to make a frontal attack and also to attack one or both of his flanks, with

  the aim of wiping out one part and routing another so that our army can swiftly

  move its troops to smash other enemy forces. Strive to avoid battles of attrition

  in which we lose more than we gain or only break even. In this way, although

  we are inferior as a whole (in terms of numbers), we are absolutely superior

  in every part and every specific campaign, and this ensures victory in the

  campaign. As time goes on, we shall become superior as a whole and eventually

  wipe out all the enemy.

  <P>

  (5) Fight no battle unprepared, fight no battle you are not sure of winning;

  make every effort to be well prepared for each battle, make every effort

  to ensure victory in the given set of conditions as between the enemy and

  ourselves.

  <P>

  (6) Give full play to our style of fighting -- courage in battle, no fear

  of sacrifice, no fear of fatigue, and continuous fighting (that is, fighting

  successive battles in a short time without rest).

  <P>

  (7) Strive to wipe out the enemy through mobile warfare. At the same time,

  pay attention to the tactics of positional attack and capture enemy fortified

  points and cities.

  <P>

  (8) With regard to attacking cities, resolutely seize all enemy fortified

  points and cities which are weakly defended. Seize at opportune moments all

  enemy fortified points and cities defended with moderate strength, provided

  circumstances permit. As for strongly defended enemy fortified points and

  cities, wait till conditions are ripe and then take them.

  <P>

  (9) Replenish our strength with all the arms and most of the personnel captured

  from the enemy. Our army's main sources of manpower and mat&eacute;riel are

  at the front.

  <P>

  (10) Make good use of the intervals between campaigns to rest, train and

  consolidate our troops. Periods of rest, training and consolidation should

  in general not be very long, and the enemy should so far as possible be permitted

  no breathing space.

The Chinese Red Army is an armed body for carrying out the political tasks

confine itself to fighting; besides fighting to destroy the enemy's military

strength, it should shoulder such important tasks as doing propaganda among

the masses, organizing the masses, arming them, helping them to establish

revolutionary political power and setting up Party organizations. The Red

Army fights not merely for the sake of fighting but in order to conduct

propaganda among the masses, organize them, arm them, and help them to establish

revolutionary political power. Without these objectives, fighting loses its

meaning and the Red Army loses the reason for its existence.

  10. LEADERSHIP OF PARTY COMMITTEES

</H2>

<P>

The Party committee system is an important Party institution for ensuring

collective leadership and preventing any individual from monopolizing the

conduct of affairs. It has recently been found that in some (of course not

all) leading bodies it is the habitual practice for one individual to monopolize

the conduct of affairs and decide important problems. Solutions to important

problems are decided not by Party committee meetings but by one individual,

and membership in the Party committee has become nominal. Differences of

opinion among committee members cannot be resolved and are left unresolved

for a long time. Members of the Party committee maintain only formal, not

real, unity among themselves. This situation must be changed. From now on,

a sound system of Party committee meetings must be instituted in all leading

bodies, from the bureaus of the Central Committee to the prefectural Party

committees; from the Party committees of the fronts to the Party committees

of brigades and military areas (sub-commissions of the Revolutionary Military

Commission or leading groups); and the leading Party members' groups in

government bodies, people's organizations, the news agency and the newspaper

offices. All important problems (of course, not the unimportant, trivial

problems, or problems whose solutions have already been decided after discussion

at meetings and need only be carried out) must be submitted to the committee

for discussion, and the committee members present should express their views

fully and reach definite decisions which should then be carried out by the

members concerned. &nbsp;. . . Party committee meetings must be divided into

two categories, standing committee meetings and plenary sessions, and the

two should not be confused. Furthermore, we must take care that neither

collective leadership nor personal responsibility is overemphasized to the

neglect of the other. In the army, the person in command has the right to

make emergency decisions during battle and when circumstances require.

The secretary of a Party committee must be good at being a "squad leader".

A Party committee has ten to twenty members; it is like a squad in the army,

and the secretary is like the "squad leader". It is indeed not easy to lead

this squad well. Each bureau or sub-bureau of the Central Committee now leads

a vast area and shoulders very heavy responsibilities. To lead means not

only to decide general and specific policies but also to devise correct methods

of work. Even with correct general and specific policies, troubles may still

arise if methods of work are neglected. To fulfil its task of exercising

leadership, a Party committee must rely on its "squad members" and enable

them to play their parts to the full. To be a good "squad leader", the secretary

should study hard and investigate thoroughly. A secretary or deputy secretary

will find it difficult to direct his "squad" well if he does not take care

to do propaganda and organizational work among his own "squad members", is

not good at handling his relations with committee members or does not study

how to run meetings successfully. If the "squad members" do not march in

step, they can never expect to lead tens of millions of people in fighting

and construction. Of course, the relation between the secretary and the committee

members is one in which the minority must obey the majority, so it is different

from the relation between a squad leader and his men. Here we speak only

by way of analogy.

<P ALIGN=Right>

"Methods of Work of Party Committees" &nbsp;(March 13, 1949), <I>Selected

Works</I>, Vol. IV, p. 377.*

<P>

Place problems on the table. This should be done not only by the "squad leader"

but by the committee members too. Do not talk behind people's backs. Whenever

problems arise, call a meeting, place the problems on the table for discussion,

take some decisions and the problems will be solved. If problems exist and

are not placed on the table, they will remain unsolved for a long time and

even drag on for years. The "squad leader" and the committee members should

show understanding in their relations with each other. Nothing is more important

than mutual understanding, support and friendship between the secretary and

the committee members, between the Central Committee and its bureaus and

between the bureaus and the area Party committees.

<P ALIGN=Right>

<I>Ibid.</I> pp. 377-78.*

<P>

"Exchange information." This means that members of a Party committee should

keep each other informed and exchange views on matters that have come to

their attention. This is of great importance in achieving a common language.

Some fail to do so and, like the people described by Lao Tzu, "do not visit

each other all their lives, though the crowing of their cocks and the barking

of their dogs are within hearing of each other". The result is that they

lack a common language.

<P ALIGN=Right>

<P>

Ask your subordinates about matters you don't understand or don't know, and

do not lightly express your approval or disapproval. . . . We should never

pretend to know what we don't know, we should "not feel ashamed to ask and

learn from people below" and we should listen carefully to the views of the

cadres at the lower levels. Be a pupil before you become a teacher; learn

from the cadres at the lower levels before you issue orders. . . . What the

cadres at the lower levels say may or may not be correct; we must analyse

it. We must heed the correct views and act upon them. . . . Listen also to

the mistaken views from below; it is wrong not to listen to them at all.

Such views, however, are not to be acted upon but to be criticized.

Learn to "play the piano". In playing the piano all ten fingers are in motion;

it won't do to move some fingers only and not others. But if all ten fingers

press down at once, there is no melody. To produce good music, the ten fingers

should move rhythmically and in co-ordination. A Party committee should keep

a firm grasp on its central task and at the same time, around the central

task, it should unfold the work in other fields. At present, we have to take

care of many fields; we must look after the work in all the areas, armed

units and departments, and not give all our attention to a few problems,

to the exclusion of others. Wherever there is a problem, we must put our

finger on it, and this is a method we must master. Some play the piano well

and some badly, and there is a great difference in the melodies they produce.

Members of Party committees must learn to "play the piano" well.

"Grasp firmly." That is to say, the Party committee must not merely "grasp",

but must "grasp firmly", its main tasks. One can get a grip on something

only when it is grasped firmly, without the slightest slackening. Not to

grasp firmly is not to grasp at all. Naturally, one cannot get a grip on

something with an open hand. When the hand is clenched as if grasping something

but is not clenched tightly, there is still no grip. Some of our comrades

do grasp the main tasks, but their grasp is not firm and so they cannot make

a success of their work. It will not do to have no grasp at all, nor will

it do if the grasp is not firm.

"Have a head for figures." That is to say, we must attend to the quantitative

aspect of a situation or problem and make a basic quantitative analysis.

Every quality manifests itself in a certain quantity, and without quantity

there can be no quality. To this day many of our comrades still do not understand

that they must attend to the quantitative aspect of things -- the basic

statistics, the main percentages and the quantitative limits that determine

the qualities of things. They have no "figures" in their heads and as a result

cannot help making mistakes.

"Notice to Reassure the Public." Notice of meetings should be given beforehand;

this is like issuing a "Notice to Reassure the Public", so that everybody

and can make timely preparations. In some places, meetings of cadres are

called without first preparing reports and draft resolutions, and only when

people have arrived for the meeting are makeshifts improvised; this is just

like the saying, "Troops and horses have arrived, but food and fodder are

not ready", and that is no good. Don't call a meeting in a hurry if the

preparations are not completed.

Draw two lines of distinction. First, between revolution and counter-revolution,

between Yenan and Sian.<B>[<A HREF="#n1">1</A>]</B> Some do not understand

that they must draw this line of distinction. For example, when they combat

bureaucracy, they speak of Yenan as though "nothing is right" there and fail

to make a comparison and distinguish between the bureaucracy in Yenan and

the bureaucracy in Sian. This is fundamentally wrong. Secondly, within the

revolutionary ranks, it is necessary to make a clear distinction between

right and wrong, between achievements and shortcomings and to make clear

which of the two is primary and which secondary. For instance, do the

achievements amount to 30 per cent or to 70 per cent of the whole? It will

not do either to understate or to overstate. We must have a fundamental

evaluation of a person's work and establish whether his achievements amount

to 30 per cent and his mistakes to 70 per cent, or vice versa. If his

achievements amount to 70 per cent of the whole, then his work should in

the main be approved. It would be entirely wrong to describe work in which

the achievements are primary as work in which the mistakes are primary. In

our approach to problems we must not forget to draw these two lines of

distinction, between revolution and counter-revolution and between achievements

and shortcomings. We shall be able to handle things well if we bear these

two distinctions in mind; otherwise we shall confuse the nature of the problems.

To draw these distinctions well, careful study and analysis are of course

necessary. Our attitude towards every person and every matter should be one

of analysis and study.

The present upsurge of the peasant movement is a colossal event. In a very

a force so swift and violent that no power, however great, will be able to

hold it back. They will smash all the trammels that bind them and rush forward

along the road to liberation. They will sweep all the imperialists, warlords,

corrupt officials, local tyrants and evil gentry into their graves. Every

revolutionary party and every revolutionary comrade will be put to the test,

to be accepted or rejected as they decide. There are three alternatives.

To march at their head and lead them? To trail behind them, gesticulating

and criticizing? Or to stand in their way and oppose them? Every Chinese

is free to choose, but events will force you to make the choice quickly.

who simply follow the old routine invariably underestimate the people's

enthusiasm. Let something new appear and they always disapprove and rush

to oppose it. Afterwards, they have to admit defeat and do a little

For over twenty years our Party has carried on mass work every day, and for

the past dozen years it has talked about the mass line every day. We have

always maintained that the revolution must rely on the masses of the people,

on everybody's taking a hand, and have opposed relying merely on a few persons

issuing orders. The mass line, however, is still not being thoroughly carried

out in the work of some comrades; they still rely solely on a handful of

people working coolly and quietly by themselves. One reason is that, whatever

they do, they are always reluctant to explain it to the people they lead

and that they do not understand why or how to give play to the initiative

and creative energy of those they lead. Subjectively, they too want everyone

to take a hand in the work, but they do not let other people know what is

to be done or how to do it. That being the case, how can everyone be expected

to get moving and how can anything be done well? To solve this problem the

basic thing is, of course, to carry out ideological education on the mass

line, but at the same time we must teach these comrades many concrete methods

can avoid commandism. Tailism in any type of work is also wrong, because

in falling below the level of political consciousness of the masses and violating

the principle of leading the masses forward it reflects the disease of

dilatoriness. Our comrades must not assume that the masses have no understanding

of what they themselves do not yet understand. It often happens that the

We should pay close attention to the well-being of the masses, from the problems

of land and labour to those of fuel, rice, cooking oil and salt. &nbsp;.

. . All such problems concerning the well-being of the masses should be placed

on our agenda. We should discuss them, adopt and carry out decisions and

check up on the results. We should help the masses to realize that we represent

their interests, that our lives are intimately bound up with theirs. We should

help them to proceed from these things to an understanding of the higher

tasks which we have put forward, the tasks of the revolutionary war, so that

they will support the revolution and spread it throughout the country, respond

to our political appeals and fight to the end for victory in the revolution.

The People's Liberation Army has developed its vigorous revolutionary political

The political work of the Eighth Route Army is guided by three basic principles.

First, the principle of unity between officers and men, which means eradicating

feudal practices in the army, prohibiting beating and abuse, building up

a conscious discipline, and sharing weal and woe--as a result of which the

entire army is closely united. Second, the principle of unity between the

army and the people, which means maintaining a discipline that forbids the

slightest violation of the people's interests, conducting propaganda among

the masses, organizing and arming them, lightening their financial burdens

and suppressing the traitors and collaborators who do harm to the army and

the people--as a result of which the army is closely united with the people

and welcomed everywhere. Third, the principle of disintegrating the enemy

troops and giving lenient treatment to prisoners of war. Our victory depends

not only upon our military operations but also upon the disintegration of

the enemy troops.

the army and the people, between the army and the government, between the

army and the Party, between officers and men, and between military work and

political work, and relations among the cadres, and must never commit the

errors of warlordism. Officers must cherish their men and must not be indifferent

to their well-being or resort to corporal punishment; the army must cherish

the people and never encroach upon their interests; the army must respect

the government and the Party and never "assert independence".

Our policy towards prisoners captured from the Japanese, puppet or anti-communist

troops is to set them all free, except for those who have incurred the bitter

sentence has been approved by the higher authorities. Among the prisoners,

those who were coerced into joining the reactionary forces but who are more

or less inclined towards the revolution should be won over in large numbers

to work for our army. The rest should be released and, if they fight us and

are captured again, should again be set free. We should not insult them,

take away their personal effects or try to exact recantations from them,

but without exception should treat them sincerely and kindly. This should

be our policy, however reactionary they may be. It is a very effective way

of isolating the hard core of reaction.

Recently there has been a falling off in ideological and political work among

students and intellectuals, and some unhealthy tendencies have appeared.

Some people seem to think that there is no longer any need to concern themselves

with politics or with the future of the motherland and the ideals of mankind.

It seems as if Marxism, once all the rage, is currently not so much in fashion.

To counter these tendencies, we must strengthen our ideological and political

work. Both students and intellectuals should study hard. In addition to the

study of their specialized subjects, they must make progress ideologically

and politically, which means they should study Marxism, current events and

politics. Not to have a correct political orientation is like having no soul.

. . . All departments and organizations should shoulder their responsibilities

for ideological and political work. This applies to the Communist Party,

the Youth League, government departments in charge of this work, and especially

to heads of educational institutions and teachers.

After receiving political education, the Red Army soldiers have become

The correct unfolding of the movement for pouring out grievances (the wrongs

done to the labouring people by the old society and by the reactionaries)

and the three check-ups (on class origin, performance of duty and will to

fight) greatly heightened the political consciousness of commanders and fighters

throughout the army in the fight for the emancipation of the exploited working

masses, for nation-wide land reform and for the destruction of the common

enemy of the people, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. It also greatly

strengthened the firm unity of all commanders and fighters under the leadership

of the Communist Party. On this basis, the army achieved greater purity in

its ranks, strengthened discipline, unfolded a mass movement for training

and further developed its political, economic and military democracy in a

completely well-led and orderly way. Thus the army has become united as one

man, with everybody contributing his ideas and his strength, fearless of

sacrifice and capable of overcoming material difficulties, an army which

displays mass heroism and daring in destroying the enemy. Such an army will

be invincible.

manifestations in the army, educated the cadres and fighters and greatly

enhanced the combat effectiveness of the army. From now on, we must continue

to carry on this new type of ideological education movement in the army,

Many people think that it is wrong methods that make for strained relations

between officers and men and between the army and the people, but I always

tell them that it is a question of basic attitude (or basic principle), of

having respect for the soldiers and the people. It is from this attitude

that the various policies, methods and forms ensue. If we depart from this

attitude, then the policies, methods and forms will certainly be wrong, and

the relations between officers and men and between the army and the people

are bound to be unsatisfactory. Our three major principles for the army's

political work are, first, unity between officers and men; second, unity

between the army and the people; and third, the disintegration of the enemy

forces. To apply these principles effectively, we must start with this basic

attitude of respect for the soldiers and the people, and of respect for the

human dignity of prisoners of war once they have laid down their arms. Those

who take all this as a technical matter and not one of basic attitude are

indeed wrong, and they should correct their view.

convince people. Coercion will never result in convincing people. To try

to convince them submit by force simply won't do. This kind of method is

permissible in dealing with the enemy, but absolutely impermissible in dealing

with comrades or friends.

A proper measure of democracy should be put into effect in the army, chiefly

by abolishing the feudal practice of bullying and beating and by having officers

Apart from the role played by the Party, the reason why the Red Army has

been able to carry on in spite of such poor material conditions and such

frequent engagements is its practice of democracy. The officers do not beat

the men; officers and men receive equal treatment, soldiers are free to hold

meetings and to speak out; trivial formalities have been done away with;

and the accounts are open for all to inspect. . . . In China the army needs

democracy as much as the people do. Democracy in our army is an important

weapon for undermining the feudal mercenary army.

The policy for political work in our army units is fully to arouse the rank

military technique and tactics. The Three Check-ups and Three Improvements

<B>[<A href="#bm1">1</A>]</B> now being enthusiastically carried out in our

army units are intended to attain the first two of these objectives through

the methods of political and economic democracy.

<P>

With regard to economic democracy, the representatives elected by the soldiers

must be ensured the right to assist (but not to bypass) the company leadership

in managing the company's supplies and mess.

<P>

With regard to military democracy, in periods of training there must be mutual

instruction as between officers and soldiers and among the soldiers themselves;

and in periods of fighting the companies at the front must hold big and small

meetings of various kinds. Under the direction of the company leadership,

the rank and file should be roused to discuss how to attack and capture enemy

positions and how to fulfil other combat tasks. When the fighting lasts several

days, several such meetings should be held. This kind of military democracy

was practiced with great success in the battle of Panlung in northern Shensi

and in the battle of Shihchiachuang<B> </B>in the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei area.

It has been proved that the practice can only do good and can do no harm

whatsoever.

In the present great struggle, the Chinese Communist Party demands that all

its leading bodies and all its members and cadres should give the fullest

expression to their initiative, which alone can ensure victory. This initiative

must be demonstrated concretely in the ability of the leading bodies, the

cadres and the Party rank and file to work creatively, in their readiness

to assume responsibility, in the exuberant vigour they show in their work,

in their courage and ability to raise questions, voice opinions and criticize

defects, and in the comradely supervision that is maintained over the leading

bodies and the leading cadres. Otherwise, "initiative" will be an empty thing.

But the exercise of such initiative depends on the spread of democracy in

Party life. It cannot be brought into play if there is not enough democracy

in Party life. Only in an atmosphere of democracy can large numbers of able

people be brought forward.

In the sphere of theory, destroy the roots of ultra-democracy. First, it

that it damages or even completely wrecks the Party organization and weakens

or even completely undermines the Party's fighting capacity, rendering the

Party incapable of fulfilling its fighting tasks and thereby causing the

defeat of the revolution. Next, it should be pointed out that the source

of ultra-democracy consists in the petty bourgeoisie's individualistic aversion

to discipline. When this characteristic is brought into the Party, it develops

into ultra-democratic ideas politically and organizationally. These ideas

are utterly incompatible with the fighting tasks of the proletariat.

  18. PATRIOTISM AND INTERNATIONALISM

</H2>

<P>

Can a Communist, who is an internationalist, at the same time be a patriot?

We hold that he not only can be but must be. The specific content of patriotism

is determined by historical conditions. There is the "patriotism" of the

Japanese aggressors and of Hitler, and there is our patriotism. Communists

must resolutely oppose the "patriotism" of the Japanese aggressors and of

Hitler. The Communists of Japan and Germany are defeatists with regard to

the wars being waged by their countries. To bring about the defeat of the

Japanese aggressors and of Hitler by every possible means is in the interests

of the Japanese and the German people, and the more complete the defeat the

better. . . . For the wars launched by the Japanese aggressors and Hitler

are harming their own people as well as the people of the world. China's

case is different, because she is the victim of aggression. Chinese Communists

must therefore combine patriotism with internationalism. We are at once

internationalists and patriots, and our slogan is, "Fight to defend the

motherland against the aggressors." For us defeatism is a crime and to strive

for victory in the War of Resistance is an inescapable duty. For only by

fighting in defence of the motherland can we defeat the aggressors and achieve

national liberation. And only by achieving national liberation will it be

possible for the proletariat and other working people to achieve their own

emancipation. The victory of China and the defeat of the invading imperialists

will help the people of other countries. Thus in wars of national liberation

patriotism is applied internationalism.

countries, with the proletariat of Japan, Britain, the United States, Germany,

Italy and all other capitalist countries, for this is the only way to overthrow

imperialism, to liberate our nation and people and to liberate the other

nations and peoples of the world. This is our internationalism, the

internationalism with which we oppose both narrow nationalism and narrow

patriotism.

We must see to it that all our cadres and all our people constantly bear

in mind that ours is a large socialist country but an economically backward

but she is still very poor. &nbsp;It will take several decades to make China

prosperous. Even then we still have to observe the principle of diligence

and frugality. &nbsp;But it is in the coming decades, during the present

series of five-year plans, that we must particularly advocate diligence and

frugality, that we must pay special attention to economy.

Wherever we happen to be, we must treasure our manpower and material resources,

Wherever we are, from the very first year of our work we must bear in mind

the many years to come, the protracted war that must be maintained, the

counter-offensive, and the work of reconstruction after the enemy's expulsion.

On the one hand, never be wasteful or extravagant; on the other, actively

expand production. Previously, in some places people suffered a great deal

because they did not take the long view and neglected economy in manpower

and material resources and the expansion of production. The lesson is there

and attention must be called to it.

Production by the army for its own support has not only improved the army's

living conditions and lightened the burden on the people, thereby making

it possible further to expand the army. In addition, it has had many immediate

side-effects. They are as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  (1) Improved relations between officers and men. Officers and men work together

  in production and become like brothers.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  (2) Better attitude to labour. &nbsp;. . . since the army began to produce

  for its own support, the attitude to labour has improved and loafer ways

  have been overcome.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  (3) Strengthened discipline. Far from weakening discipline in battle and

  in army life, labour discipline in production actually strengthens it.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  (4) Improved relations between the army and the people. Once an armed force

  begins to "keep house" for itself, encroachments upon the property of the

  people seldom or never occur. As the army and the people exchange labour

  and help each other in production, the friendship between them is strengthened.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  (5) Less grumbling in the army about the government and improved relations

  between the two.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  (6) An impetus to the great production campaign of the people. Once the army

  engages in production, the need for government and other organizations to

  do likewise becomes more obvious, and they do so more energetically; also,

  the need for a universal campaign of the whole people to increase production

  naturally becomes more obvious, and this too is carried on more energetically.

Some people say that if the army units go in for production, they will be

unable to train or fight and that if the government and other organizations

do so, they will be unable to do their own work. This is a false argument.

In recent years our army units in the Border Region have undertaken production

on a big scale to provide themselves with ample food and clothing and have

simultaneously done their training and conducted their political studies

and literacy and other courses much more successfully than before, and there

is greater unity than ever within the army and between the army and the people.

While there was a large-scale production campaign at the front last year,

great successes were gained in the fighting and in addition an extensive

training campaign was started. And thanks to production, the personnel of

the government and other organizations live a better life and work with greater

devotion and efficiency; this is the case both in the Border Region and at

the front.

there would be more difficulties rather than less. Some comrades do not like

to think much about difficulties. But difficulties are facts; we must recognize

as many difficulties as there are and should not adopt a "policy of

non-recognition". We must recognize difficulties, analyse them and combat

them. There are no straight roads in the world; we must be prepared to follow

a road which twists and turns and not try to get things on the cheap. It

must not be imagined that one fine morning all the reactionaries will go

There is an ancient Chinese fable called "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed

the Mountains". It tells of an old man who lived in northern China long,

long ago and was known as the Foolish Old Man of North Mountain. His house

faced south and beyond his doorway stood the two great peaks, Taihang and

Wangwu, obstructing the way. He called his sons, and hoe in hand they began

to dig up these mountains with great determination. Another graybeard, known

as the Wise Old Man, saw them and said derisively, "How silly of you to do

this! It is quite impossible for you few to dig up those two huge mountains."

The Foolish Old Man replied, "When I die, my sons will carry on; when they

die, there will be my grandsons, and then their sons and grandsons, and so

on to infinity. High as they are, the mountains cannot grow any higher and

with every bit we dig, they will be that much lower. Why can't we clear them

away?" Having refuted the Wise Old Man's wrong view, he went on digging every

day, unshaken in his conviction. God was moved by this, and he sent down

two angels, who carried the mountains away on their backs. Today, two big

mountains lie like a dead weight on the Chinese people. One is imperialism,

the other is feudalism. The Chinese Communist Party has long made up its

mind to dig them up. We must persevere and work unceasingly, and we, too,

will touch God's heart. Our God is none other than the masses of the Chinese

people. If they stand up and dig together with us, why can't these two mountains

be cleared away?

  22. METHODS OF THINKING AND METHODS OF WORK

</H2>

<P>

The history of mankind is one of continuous development from the realm of

necessity to the realm of freedom. This process is never-ending. In any society

in which classes exist class struggle will never end. In classless society

the struggle between the new and the old and between truth and falsehood

will never end. In the fields of the struggle for production and scientific

experiment, mankind makes constant progress and nature undergoes constant

change; they never remain at the same level. Therefore, man has constantly

to sum up experience and go on discovering, inventing, creating and advancing.

Ideas of stagnation, pessimism inertia and complacency are all wrong. They

are wrong because they agree neither with the historical facts of social

development over the past million years, nor with the historical facts of

nature so far known to us (<I>i.e.</I>, nature as revealed in the history

of celestial bodies, the earth, life, and other natural phenomena).

First Session of the Third National People's Congress of the People's Republic

of China" (December 21-22, 1964).

<P>

Natural science is one of man's weapons in his fight for freedom. For the

purpose of attaining freedom in society, man must use social science to

understand and change society and carry out social revolution. For the purpose

of attaining freedom in the world of nature, man must use natural science

to understand, conquer and change nature and thus attain freedom from nature.

The Marxist philosophy of dialectical materialism has two outstanding

characteristics. One is its class nature: it openly avows that dialectical

materialism is in the service of the proletariat. The other is its practicality:

it emphasizes the dependence of theory on practice, emphasizes that theory

is based on practice and in turn serves practice.

<P ALIGN=Right>

"On Practice" (July 1937), <I>Selected Works</I>, Vol. I, p. 297.

<P>

Marxist philosophy holds that the most important problem does not lie in

understanding the laws of the objective world and thus being able to explain

it, but in applying the knowledge of these laws actively to change the world.

<P ALIGN=Right>

<I>Ibid</I>.. p. 304.

<P>

Where do correct ideas come from? Do they drop from the skies? No. Are they

innate in the mind? No. They come from social practice, and from it alone;

they come from three kinds of social practice, the struggle for production,

the class struggle and scientific experiment.

<P ALIGN=Right>

<I>Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?</I> (May 1963), 1st pocket ed., p. 1.

<P>

It is man's social being that determines his thinking. Once the correct ideas

characteristic of the advanced class are grasped by the masses, these ideas

turn into a material force which changes society and changes the world.

<P ALIGN=Right>

<I>Ibid.</I>

<P>

In their social practice, men engage in various kinds of struggle and gain

rich experience, both from their successes and from their failures. Countless

phenomena of the objective external world are reflected in a man's brain

through his five sense organs&#151; the organs of sight, heating, smell,

taste and touch. At first, knowledge is perceptual. The leap to conceptual

knowledge, <I>i.e.</I>, to ideas, occurs when sufficient perceptual knowledge

is accumulated. This is one process in cognition. It is the first stage in

the whole process of cognition, the stage leading from objective matter to

subjective consciousness, from existence to ideas. Whether or not one's

consciousness or ideas (including theories, policies, plans or measures)

do correctly reflect the laws of the objective external world is not yet

proved at this stage, in which it is not yet possible to ascertain whether

they are correct or not. Then comes the second stage in the process of cognition,

the stage leading from consciousness back to matter, from ideas back to

existence, in which the knowledge gained in the first stage is applied in

social practice to ascertain whether the theories, policies, plans or measures

meet with the anticipated success. Generally speaking, those that succeed

are correct and those that fail are incorrect, and this is especially true

of man's struggle with nature. In social struggle, the forces representing

the advanced class sometimes suffer defeat not because their ideas are incorrect

but because, in the balance of forces engaged in struggle, they are not as

powerful for the time being as the forces of reaction; they are therefore

temporarily defeated, but they are bound to triumph sooner or later. Man's

knowledge makes another leap through the test of practice. This leap is more

important than the previous one. For it is this leap alone that can prove

the correctness or incorrectness of the first leap in cognition, <I>i.e.</I>,

of the ideas, theories, policies, plans or measures formulated in the course

of reflecting the objective external world. There is no other way of testing

truth.

<P ALIGN=Right>

<I>Ibid.</I>, pp. 1-3.*

<P>

Often, correct knowledge can be arrived at only after many repetitions of

the process leading from matter to consciousness and then back to matter,

that is, leading from practice to knowledge and then back to practice. Such

is the Marxist theory of knowledge, the dialectical materialist theory of

knowledge.

<P>

Whoever wants to know a thing has no way of doing so except by coming into

contact with it, that is, by living (practising) in its environment. &nbsp;.

. . If you want knowledge, you must take part in the practice of changing

reality. If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear

by eating it yourself. &nbsp;. . . If you want to know the theory and methods

of revolution, you must take part in revolution. All genuine knowledge originates

in direct experience.

<P>

Knowledge begins with practice, and theoretical knowledge is acquired through

practice and must then return to practice. The active function of knowledge

manifests itself not only in the active leap from perceptual to rational

knowledge, but--and this is more important--it must manifest itself in the

leap from rational knowledge to revolutionary practice.

If a man wants to succeed in his work, that is, to achieve the anticipated

results, he must bring his ideas into correspondence with the laws of the

objective external world; if they do not correspond, he will fail in his

practice. After he fails, he draws his lessons, corrects his ideas to make

them correspond to the laws of the external world, and can thus turn failure

into success; this is what is meant by "failure is the mother of success"

and "a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit".

Idealism and metaphysics are the easiest things in the world, because people

can talk as much nonsense as they like without basing it on objective reality

or having it tested against reality. Materialism and dialectics, on the other

Unless one makes the effort, one is liable to slip into idealism and metaphysics.

The fundamental cause of the development of a thing is not external but internal;

it lies in the contradictoriness within the thing. There is internal

contradiction in every single thing, hence its motion and development.

Contradictoriness within a thing is the fundamental cause of its development,

while its interrelations and interactions with other things are secondary

causes.

It [materialist dialectics] holds that external causes are the condition

of change and internal causes are the basis of change, and that external

causes become operative through internal causes. In a suitable temperature

an egg changes into a chicken, but no temperature can change a stone into

Marxist philosophy holds that the law of the unity of opposites is the

fundamental law of the universe. This law operates universally, whether in

the natural world, in human society, or in man's thinking. Between the opposites

in a contradiction there is at once unity and struggle, and it is this that

impels things to move and change. Contradictions exist everywhere, but they

differ in accordance with the different nature of different things. In any

given phenomenon or thing, the unity of opposites is conditional, temporary

and transitory, and hence relative, whereas the struggle of opposites is

absolute.

Concrete analysis of concrete conditions, Lenin said, is "the most essential

thing in Marxism, the living soul of Marxism". Lacking an analytical approach,

many of our comrades do not want to go deeply into complex matters, to analyse

are either absolutely affirmative or absolutely negative. &nbsp;. . . From

now on we should remedy this state of affairs.

The way these comrades look at problems is wrong. They do not look at the

essential or main aspects but emphasize the non-essential or minor ones.

It should be pointed out that these non-essential or minor aspects must not

as the essential or main aspects, or we will lose our bearings.

<P>

Only those who are subjective, one-sided and superficial in their approach

to problems will smugly issue orders or directives the moment they arrive

on the scene, without considering the circumstances, without viewing things

in their totality (their history and their present state as a whole) and

without getting to the essence of things (their nature and the internal relations

between one thing and another). Such people are bound to trip and fall.

<P ALIGN=Right>

"On Practice." (July 1937), <I>Selected Works</I>, Vol. I, p. 302.

<P>

In studying a problem, we must shun subjectivity, one-sidedness and

superficiality. To be subjective means not to look at problems objectively,

that is, not to use the materialist viewpoint in looking at problems. I have

discussed this in my essay "On Practice". To be one-sided means not to look

at problems all-sidedly. &nbsp;. . . Or it may be called seeing the part

but not the whole, seeing the trees but not the forest. That way it is impossible

to kind the method for resolving a contradiction, it is impossible to accomplish

the tasks of the revolution, to carry out assignments well or to develop

inner-Party ideological struggle correctly. When Sun Wu Tzu said in discussing

military science, "Know the enemy and know yourself, and you can fight a

hundred battles with no danger of defeat", he was referring to the two sides

in a battle. Wei Chengi of the Tang Dynasty also understood the error of

one-sidedness when he said, "Listen to both sides and you will be enlightened,

heed only one side and you will be benighted." But our comrades often look

at problems one-sidedly, and so they often run into snags. &nbsp;. . . Lenin

said:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  . . . in order really to know an object we must embrace, study, all its sides,

  all connections and "mediations". We shall never achieve this completely,

  but the demand for all-sidedness is a safeguard against mistakes and rigidity.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

We should remember his words. To be superficial means to consider neither

the characteristics of a contradiction in its totality nor the characteristics

of each of its aspects; it means to deny the necessity for probing deeply

into a thing and minutely studying the characteristics of its contradiction,

but instead merely to look from afar and, after glimpsing the rough outline,

immediately to try to resolve the contradiction (to answer a question, settle

a dispute, handle work, or direct a military operation). This way of doing

things is bound to lead to trouble. &nbsp;. . . To be one-sided and superficial

is at the same time to be subjective. For all objective things are actually

interconnected and are governed by inner laws, but instead of undertaking

the task of reflecting things as they really are some people only look at

things one-sidedly or superficially and who know neither their interconnections

nor their inner laws, and so their method is subjectivist.

<P ALIGN=Right>

"On Contradiction" (August 1937), <I>Selected Works</I>, Vol. I, pp. 323-24.*

<P>

One-sidedness means thinking in terms of absolutes, that is, a metaphysical

approach to problems. In the appraisal of our work, it is one-sided to regard

everything either as all positive or as all negative. &nbsp;. . . To regard

everything as positive is to see only the good and not the bad, and to tolerate

only praise and no criticism. To talk as though our work is good in every

respect is at variance with the facts. It is not true that everything is

good; there are still shortcomings and mistakes. But neither is it true that

everything is bad, and that, too, is at variance with the facts. Here analysis

is necessary. To negate everything is to think, without having made any analysis,

that nothing has been done well and that the great work of socialist

construction, the great struggle in which hundreds of millions of people

are participating, is a complete mess with nothing in it worth commending.

Although there is a difference between the many people who hold such views

and those who are hostile to the socialist system, these views are very mistaken

and harmful and can only dishearten people. It is wrong to appraise our work

either from the viewpoint that everything is positive, or from the viewpoint

that everything is negative.

If in any process there are a number of contradictions, one of them must

contradiction is grasped, all problems can be readily solved.

In any given place, there cannot be a number of central tasks at the same

with over-all responsibility in the locality must take into account the history

and circumstances of the struggle there and put the different tasks in their

proper order; he should not act upon each instruction as it comes from the

higher organization without any planning of his own, and thereby create a

multitude of "central tasks" and a state of confusion and disorder. Nor should

a higher organization simultaneously assign many tasks to a lower organization

without indicating their relative importance and urgency or without specifying

which is central, for that will lead to confusion in the steps to be taken

by the lower organizations in their work and thus no definite results will

be achieved. It is part of the art of leadership to take the whole situation

into account and plan accordingly in the light of the historical conditions

and existing circumstances of each locality, decide correctly on the centre

</H2>

<P>

Everyone engaged in practical work must investigate conditions at the lower

levels. Such investigation is especially necessary for those who know theory

but do not know the actual conditions, for otherwise they will not be able

to link theory with practice. Although my assertion, "No investigation, no

right to speak", has been ridiculed as "narrow empiricism", to this day I

do not regret having made it; what is more, I still insist that without

investigation there cannot possibly be any right to speak. There are many

people who "the moment they alight from the official carriage" make a hullabaloo,

spout opinions, criticize this and condemn that; but, in fact, ten out of

ten of them will meet with failure. For such views or criticisms, which are

not based on thorough investigation, are nothing but ignorant twaddle. Countless

times our Party suffered at the hands of these "imperial envoys", who rushed

here, there and everywhere. Stalin rightly says that "theory becomes purposeless

if it is not connected with revolutionary practice". And he rightly adds

that "practice gropes in the dark if its path is not illumined by revolutionary

theory". Nobody should be labelled a "narrow empiricist" except the "practical

man" who gropes in the dark and lacks perspective and foresight.

To take such an attitude is to seek truth from facts. "Facts" are all the

things that exist objectively, "truth" means their internal relations, that

from the actual conditions inside and outside the country, the province,

county or district, and derive from them, as our guide to action, laws which

are inherent in them and not imaginary, that is, we should find the internal

relations of the events occurring around us. And in order to do that we must

rely not on subjective imagination, not on momentary enthusiasm, not on lifeless

books, but on facts that exist objectively; we must appropriate the material

in detail and, guided by the general principles of Marxism-Leninism, draw

correct conclusions from it.

the fundamental spirit of Marxism-Leninism. Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin

brains on his own, or together with a group, to "find a soltuion" or "evolve

an idea" without making any investigation. &nbsp;It must be stressed that

this cannot possibly lead to any effective solution or any good idea.

from a thorough and necessary reconnaissance and from pondering on and piecing

together the data of various kinds gathered through reconnaissance. He applies

all possible and necessary methods of reconnaissance, and ponders on the

information gathered about the enemy's situation, discarding the dross and

selecting the essential, eliminating the false and retaining the true, proceeding

from the one to the other and from the outside to the inside; then, he takes

the conditions on his own side into account, and makes a study of both sides

and their interrelations, thereby forming his judgements, making up his mind

and working out his plans. Such is the complete process of knowing a situation

which a military man goes through before he formulates a strategic plan,

a campaign plan or a battle plan.

Even if we achieve gigantic successes in our work, there is no reason whatsoever

to feel conceited and arrogant. &nbsp;Modesty helps one to go forward, whereas

conceit makes one lag behind. &nbsp;This is a truth we must always bear in

mind.

With victory, certain moods may grow within the Party -- arrogance, the airs

of a self-styled hero, inertia and unwillingness to make progress, love of

pleasure and distaste for continued hard living. With victory, the people

will be grateful to us and the bourgeoisie will come forward to flatter us.

It has been proved that the enemy cannot conquer us by force of arms. However,

the flattery of the bourgeoisie may conquer the weak-willed in our ranks.

There may be some Communists, who were not conquered by enemies with guns

and were worthy of the name of heroes for standing up to these enemies, but

who cannot withstand sugar-coated bullets; they will be defeated by sugar-coated

bullets. We must guard against such a situation.

Many things may become baggage, may become encumbrances, if we cling to them

blindly and uncritically. Let us take some illustrations. Having made mistakes,

you may feel that, come what may, you are saddled with them and so become

dispirited if you have not made mistakes, you may feel that you are free

from error and so become conceited. Lack of achievement in work may breed

pessimism and depression, while achievement may breed pride and arrogance.

A comrade with a short record of struggle may shirk responsibility on this

account, while a veteran may become opinionated because of his long record

of struggle. Worker and peasant comrades, because of pride in their class

origin, may look down upon intellectuals, while intellectuals, because they

have a certain amount of knowledge, may look down upon workers and peasants.

Any specialized skill may be capitalized on and so may lead to arrogance

and contempt of others. Even one's age may become ground for conceit. The

young, because they are bright and capable, may look down upon the old; and

the old, because they are rich in experience, may look down upon the young.

All such things become encumbrances or baggage if there is no critical awareness.

the heavy loads themselves; they are the first to bear hardships, the last

for the Party, in practice they put themselves first and the Party second.

What are these people after? They are after fame and position and want to

be in the limelight. Whenever they are put in charge of a branch of work,

they assert their "independence". With this aim, they draw some people in,

push others out and resort to boasting, flattery and touting among the comrades,

thus importing the vulgar style of the bourgeois political parties into the

Communist Party. It is their dishonesty that causes them to come to grief.

Liberalism manifests itself in various ways.

<P>

clearly gone wrong, and refrain from principled argument because he is an

old acquaintance, a fellow townsman, a schoolmate, a close friend, a loved

one, an old colleague or old<B> </B>subordinate. Or to touch on the matter

lightly instead of going into it thoroughly, so as to keep on good terms.

The result is that both the organization and the individual are harmed. This

is one type of liberalism.

<P>

To indulge in irresponsible criticism in private instead of actively putting

forward one's suggestions to the organization. To say nothing to people to

their faces but to gossip behind their backs, or to say nothing at a meeting

but to gossip afterwards. To show no regard at all for the principles of

collective life but to follow one's own inclination. This is a second type.

<P>

To let things drift if they do not affect one personally; to say as little

as possible while knowing perfectly well what is wrong, to be worldly wise

and play safe and seek only to avoid blame. This is a third type.

<P>

Not to obey orders but to give pride of place to one's own opinions. To demand

special consideration from the organization but to reject its discipline.

This is a fourth type.

<P>

To indulge in personal attacks, pick quarrels, vent personal spite or seek

revenge instead of entering into an argument and struggling against incorrect

views for the sake of unity or progress or getting the work done properly.

This is a fifth type.

<P>

To hear incorrect views without rebutting them and even to hear

counter-revolutionary remarks without reporting them, but instead to take

them calmly as if nothing had happened. This is a sixth type.

<P>

To be among the masses and fail to conduct propaganda and agitation or speak

at meetings or conduct investigations and inquiries among them, and instead

to be indifferent to them and show no concern for their well-being, forgetting

that one is a Communist and behaving as if one were an ordinary non-Communist.

This is a seventh type.

<P>

To see someone harming the interests of the masses and yet not feel indignant,

or dissuade or stop him or reason with him, but to allow him to continue.

This is an eighth type.

<P>

To work half-heartedly without a definite plan or direction; to work

perfunctorily and muddle along--"So long as one remains a monk, one goes

on tolling the bell." This is a ninth type.

To regard oneself as having rendered great service to the revolution, to

pride oneself on being a veteran, to disdain minor assignments while being

quite unequal to major tasks, to be slipshod in work and slack in study.

Conscientious practice of self-criticism is still another hallmark distinguishing

dust, and also need sweeping and washing. The proverb "Running water is never

stale and a door-hinge is never worm-eaten" means that constant motion prevents

the inroads of germs and other organisms. To check up regularly on our work

and in the process develop a democratic style of work, to fear neither criticism

nor self-criticism, and to apply such good popular Chinese maxims as "Say

all you know and say it without reserve", "Blame not the speaker but be warned

by his words" and "Correct mistakes if you have committed them and guard

against them if you have not"-- this is the only effective way to prevent

all kinds of political dust and germs from contaminating the minds of our

In opposing subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped Party writing we must

have in mind two purposes: first, "learn from past mistakes to avoid future

ones", and second, "cure the sickness to save the patient". The mistakes

of the past must be exposed without sparing anyone's sensibilities; it is

necessary to analyse and criticize what was bad in the past with a scientific

attitude so that work in the future will be done more carefully and done

better. This is what is meant by "learn from past mistakes to avoid future

ones". But our aim in exposing errors and criticizing shortcomings, like

that of a doctor curing a sickness, is solely to save the patient and not

to doctor him to death. A person with appendicitis is saved when the surgeon

removes his appendix. So long as a person who has made mistakes does not

hide his sickness for fear of treatment or persist in his mistakes until

he is beyond cure, so long as he honestly and sincerely wishes to be cured

and to mend his ways, we should welcome him and cure his sickness so that

he can become a good comrade. We can never succeed if we just let ourselves

go, and lash out at him. In treating an ideological or a political malady,

one must never be rough and rash but must adopt the approach of "curing the

sickness to save the patient", which is the only correct and effective method.

Another point that should be mentioned in connection with inner-Party criticism

is that some comrades ignore the major issues and confine their attention

the main task of criticism is to point out political and organizational mistakes.

As to personal shortcomings, unless they are related to political and

organizational mistakes, there is no need to be overcritical and to embarrass

the comrades concerned. Moreover, once such criticism develops, there is

the great danger that the Party members will concentrate entirely on minor

faults, and everyone will become timid and overcautious and forget the Party's

political tasks.

Inner-Party criticism is a weapon for strengthening the Party organization

of criticism is to increase the Party's fighting capacity in order to achieve

victory in the class struggle and that it should not be used as a means of

personal attack.

  29. CADRES

</H2>

<P>

In order to guarantee that our Party and country do not change their colour,

we must not only have a correct line and correct policies but must train

and bring up millions of successors who will carry on the cause of proletarian

revolution.

<P>

In the final analysis, the question of training successors for the revolutionary

cause of the proletariat is one of whether or not there will be people who

can carry on the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary cause started by the older

generation of proletarian revolutionaries, whether or not the leadership

of our Party and state will remain in the hands of proletarian revolutionaries,

whether or not our descendants will continue to march along the correct road

laid down by Marxism-Leninism, or, in other words, whether or not we can

successfully prevent the emergence of Khrushchovite revisionism in China.

In short, it is an extremely important question, <A NAME="fnp72"> </A>a matter

of life and death for our Party and our country. It is a question of fundamental

importance to the proletarian revolutionary cause for a hundred, a thousand,

nay ten thousand years. Basing themselves on the changes in the Soviet Union,

the imperialist prophets are pinning their hopes of "peaceful evolution"

on the third or fourth generation of the Chinese Party. We must shatter these

imperialist prophecies. From our highest organizations down to the grass-roots,

we must everywhere give constant attention to the training and upbringing

of successors to the revolutionary cause.

<P>

What are the requirements for worthy successors to the revolutionary cause

of the proletariat?

<P>

They must be genuine Marxist-Leninists and not revisionists like Khrushchov

wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism.

<P>

They must be revolutionaries who whole-heartedly serve the majority of the

people of China and the whole world, and must not be like Khrushchov who

serves both the interests of the handful of members of the privileged bourgeois

stratum in his own country and those of foreign imperialism and reaction.

<P>

They must be proletarian statesmen capable of uniting and working together

with the overwhelming majority. Not only must they unite with those who agree

with them, they must also be good at uniting with those who disagree and

even with those who formerly opposed them and have since been proved wrong.

But they must especially watch out for careerists and conspirators like

Khrushchov and prevent such bad elements from usurping the leadership of

the Party and government at any level.

<P>

They must be models in applying the Party's democratic centralism, must master

the method of leadership based on the principle of "from the masses, to the

masses", and must cultivate a democratic style and be good at listening to

the masses. They must not be despotic like Khrushchov and violate the Party's

democratic centralism, make surprise attacks on comrades or act arbitrarily

and dictatorially.

<P>

They must be modest and prudent and guard against arrogance and impetuosity;

they must be imbued with the spirit of self-criticism and have the courage

to correct mistakes and shortcomings in their work. They must not cover up

their errors like Khrushchov, and claim all the credit for themselves and

shift all the blame on others.

<P>

Successors to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat come forward in

mass struggles and are tempered in the great storms of revolution. It is

essential to test and know cadres and choose and train successors in the

long course of mass struggle.

<P>

Our Party organizations must be extended all over the country and we must

purposefully train tens of thousands of cadres and hundreds of first-rate

leaders. They must be cadres and leaders versed in Marxism-Leninism, politically

far-sighted, competent in work, full of the spirit of self-sacrifice, capable

of tackling problems on their own, steadfast in the midst of difficulties

and loyal and devoted in serving the nation, the class and the Party. It

is on these cadres and leaders that the Party relies for its links with the

membership and the masses, and it is by relying on their firm leadership

of the masses that the Party can succeed in defeating the enemy. Such cadres

and leaders must be free from selfishness, from individualistic heroism,

ostentation, sloth, passivity, and sectarian arrogance, and they must be

selfless national and class heroes; such are the qualities and the style

of work demanded of the members, cadres and leaders of our Party.

The criterion the Communist Party should apply in its cadres policy is whether

or not a cadre is resolute in carrying out the Party line, keeps to Party

discipline, has close ties with the masses, has the ability to find his bearings

independently, and is active, hard-working and unselfish. This is what

"appointing people on their merit" means.

<P ALIGN=Right>

<I>Ibid.</I>

<P>

It is necessary to maintain the system of cadre participation in collective

productive labour. The cadres of our Party and state are ordinary workers

and not overlords sitting on the backs of the people. By taking part in

collective productive labour, the cadres maintain extensive, constant and

close ties with the working people. This is a major measure of fundamental

importance for a socialist system; it helps to overcome bureaucracy and to

prevent revisionism and dogmatism.

We must know how to judge cadres. We must not confine our judgement to a

short period or a single incident in a cadre's life, but should consider

his life and work as a whole. This is the principal method of judging cadres.

<P>

We must know how to use cadres well. In the final analysis, leadership involves

two main responsibilities: to work out ideas, and to use cadres well. Such

things as drawing up plans, making decisions, and giving orders and directives,

are all in the category of "working out ideas". To put the ideas into practice,

we must weld the cadres together and encourage them to go into action; this

comes into the category of "using the cadres well".

<P ALIGN=Right>

<I>Ibid.</I>

<P>

We must know how to take good care of cadres. There are several ways of doing

so.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  First, give them guidance. This means allowing them a free hand in their

  work so that they have the courage to assume responsibility and, at the same

  time, giving them timely instructions so that, guided by the Party's political

  line, they are able to make full use of their initiative.

  <P>

  Second, raise their level. This means educating them by giving them the

  opportunity to study so that they can enhance their theoretical understanding

  and their working ability.

  <P>

  Third, check up on their work, and help them sum up their experience, carry

  forward their achievements and correct their mistakes. To assign work without

  checking up and to take notice only when serious mistakes are made--that

  is not the way to take care of cadres.

  <P>

  Fourth, in general, use the method of persuasion with cadres who have made

  mistakes, and help them correct their mistakes. The method of struggle should

  be confined to those who make serious mistakes and nevertheless refuse to

  accept guidance. Here patience is essential. It is wrong lightly to label

  people "opportunists" or lightly to begin "waging struggles" against them.

  <P>

  Fifth, help them with their difficulties. When cadres are in difficulty as

  a result of illness, straitened means or domestic or other troubles, we must

  be sure to give them as much care as possible.

A leading group that is genuinely united and linked with the masses can gradually

be formed only in the process of mass struggle, and not in isolation from

it. In the process of a great struggle, the composition of the leading group

in most cases should not and cannot remain entirely unchanged throughout

the initial, middle and final stages; the activists who come forward in the

course of the struggle must constantly be promoted to replace those original

members of the leading group who are inferior by comparison or who have

degenerated.

If our Party does not have a great many new cadres working in unity and

co-operation with the old cadres, our cause will come to a stop. All old

cadres, therefore, should welcome the new ones with the utmost enthusiasm

and show them the warmest solicitude. True, new cadres have their shortcomings.

They have not been long in the revolution and lack experience, and unavoidably

some have brought with them vestiges of the unwholesome ideology of the old

society, remnants of the ideology of petty-bourgeois individualism. But such

shortcomings can be gradually eliminated through education and tempering

in the revolution. The strong point of the new cadres, as Stalin has said,

is that they are acutely sensitive to what is new and are therefore enthusiastic

and active to a high degree--the very qualities which some of the old cadres

lack. Cadres, new and old, should respect each other, learn from each other

and overcome their own shortcomings by learning from each other's strong

points, so as to unite as one in the common cause and guard against sectarian

tendencies.

work needed before a happy socialist society can be established. That is

How should we judge whether a youth is a revolutionary? How can we tell?

There can only be one criterion, namely, whether or not he is willing to

integrate himself with the broad masses of workers and peasants and does

so in practice. If he is willing to do so and actually does so, he is a

revolutionary; otherwise he is a non-revolutionary or a counter-revolutionary.

If today he integrates himself with the masses of workers and peasants, then

today he is a revolutionary; if tomorrow he ceases to do so or turns round

to oppress the common people, then he becomes a non-revolutionary or a

counter-revolutionary.

The intellectuals often tend to be subjective and individualistic, impractical

heart and soul into mass revolutionary struggles, or made up their minds

to serve the interests of the masses and become one with them. Hence although

the mass of revolutionary intellectuals in China can play a vanguard role

or serve as a link with the masses, not all of them will remain revolutionaries

to the end. Some will drop out of the revolutionary ranks at critical moments

and become passive, while a few may even become enemies of the revolution.

The intellectuals can overcome their shortcomings only in mass struggles

over a long period.

  31. WOMEN

</H2>

<P>

A man in China is usually subjected to the domination of three systems of

authority [political authority, clan authority and religious authority] .

. . . As for women, in addition to being dominated by these three systems

of authority, they are also dominated by the men (the authority of the husband).

These four authorities--political, clan, religious and masculine--are the

embodiment of the whole feudal-patriarchal system and ideology, and are the

four thick ropes binding the Chinese people, particularly the peasants. How

the peasants have overthrown the political authority of the landlords in

the countryside has been described above. The political authority of the

landlords is the backbone of all the other systems of authority. With that

overturned, the clan authority, the religious authority and the authority

of the husband all begin to totter. &nbsp;. . . As to the authority of the

husband, this has always been weaker among the poor peasants because, out

of economic necessity, their womenfolk have to do more manual labour than

the women of the richer classes and therefore have more say and greater power

of decision in family matters. With the increasing bankruptcy of the rural

economy in recent years, the basis for men's domination over women has already

been undermined. With the rise of the peasant movement, the women in many

places have now begun to organize rural women's associations; the opportunity

has come for them to lift up their heads, and the authority of the husband

is getting shakier every day. In a word, the whole feudal-patriarchal system

and ideology is tottering with the growth of the peasants' power.

In the world today all culture, all literature and art belong to definite

classes and are geared to definite political lines. There is in fact no such

thing as art for art's sake, art that stands above classes or art that is

the process of studying Marxism and society. Only in this way can we have

a truly proletarian literature and art.

one mind.

<P>

In literary and art criticism there are two criteria, the political and the

artistic. . . .

<P>

There is the political criterion and there is the artistic criterion; what

is the relationship between the two? Politics cannot be equated with art,

nor can a general world outlook be equated with a method of artistic creation

and criticism. We deny not only that there is an abstract and absolutely

unchangeable political criterion, but also that there is an abstract and

absolutely unchangeable artistic criterion; each class in every class society

has its own political and artistic criteria. But all classes in all class

societies invariably put the political criterion first and the artistic criterion

second. &nbsp;. . . What we demand is the unity of politics and art, the

unity of content and form, the unity of revolutionary political content and

the highest possible perfection of artistic form. Works of art which lack

artistic quality have no force, however progressive they are politically.

Therefore, we oppose both the tendency to produce works of art with a wrong

political viewpoint and the tendency towards the "poster and slogan style"

which is correct in political viewpoint but lacking in artistic power. On

questions of literature and art we must carry on a struggle on two fronts.

Letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend

art should develop freely and different schools in science should contend

freely. We think that it is harmful to the growth of art and science if

administrative measures are used to impose one particular style of art or

school of thought and to ban another. Questions of right and wrong in the

arts and science should be settled through free discussion in artistic and

scientific circles and through practical work in these fields. They should

not be settled in summary fashion.

We can learn what we did not know. &nbsp;We are not only good at destroying

the old world, we are also good at building the new.

Now, there are two different attitudes towards learning from others. One

is the dogmatic attitude of transplanting everything, whether or not it is

suited to our conditions. This is no good. The other attitude is to use our

heads and learn those things which suit our conditions, that is, to absorb

whatever experience is useful to us. That is the attitude we should adopt.

The theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin is universally applicable. We

should regard it not as a dogma, but as a guide to action. Studying it is

not merely a matter of learning terms and phrases but of learning

Marxism-Leninism as the science of revolution. It is not just a matter of

understanding the general laws derived by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin

from their extensive study of real life and revolutionary experience, but

of studying their standpoint and method in examining and solving problems.

If we have a correct theory but merely prate about it, pigeonhole it and

do not put it into practice, then that theory, however good, is of no

significance.

It is necessary to master Marxist theory and apply it, master it for the

sole purpose of applying it. If you can apply the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint

in elucidating one or two practical problems, you should be commended and

credited with some achievement. The more problems you elucidate and the more

comprehensively and profoundly you do so, the greater will be your achievement.

How is Marxist-Leninist theory to be linked with the practice of the Chinese

revolution? To use a common expression, it is by "shooting the arrow at the

target". As the arrow is to the target, so is Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese

revolution. Some comrades, however, are "shooting without a target", shooting

at random, and such people are liable to harm the revolution.

Those experienced in work must take up the study of theory and must read

seriously; only then will they be able to systematize and synthesize their

experience and raise it to the level of theory, only then will they not mistake

their partial experience for universal truth and not commit empiricist errors.

Reading is learning, but applying is also learning and the more important

kind of learning at that. Our chief method is to learn warfare through warfare.

A person who has had no opportunity to go to school can also learn warfare--he

can learn through fighting in war. A revolutionary war is a mass undertaking,

it is often n a matter of first learning and then doing, but of doing and

the learning, for doing is itself learning.

There is a gap between the ordinary civilian and the soldier, but it is no

Great Wall, and <I>it </I>can be quickly closed, and the way to close it

is to take part in revolution in war. By saying that it is not easy to learn

and to apply, we mean that It Is hard to learn thoroughly and to apply

skillfully. By saying that civilians can very quickly become soldiers, we

mean that it is not difficult to cross the threshold. To put the two statements

together we may cite the Chinese adage, "Nothing in the world is difficult

for one who sets his mind to it." To cross the threshold is not difficult

and mastery, too, is possible provided one sets one's mind to the task and

is good at learning.

We must learn to do economic work from all who know how, no matter who they

are. We must esteem them as teachers, learning from them respectfully and

conscientiously. We must not pretend to know when we do not know.

Complacency is the enemy of study. We cannot really learn anything until

we rid ourselves of complacency. Our attitude towards ourselves should be

"to be insatiable in learning" and towards others "to be tireless in teaching".

Some people have read a few Marxist books and think themselves quite learned,

but what they have read has not penetrated, has not struck root in their

minds, so that they do not know how to use it and their class feelings remain

as of old. Others are very conceited and having learned some book-phrases,

they think themselves terrific and are very cocky; but whenever a storm blows

up, they take a stand very different from that of the workers and the great

majority of the peasants. They waver while the latter stand firm, they equivocate

while the latter are forthright.

In order to have a real grasp of Marxism, one must learn it not only from

books, but chiefly through class struggle, through practical work and close

contact with the masses of workers and peasants. When in addition to reading

some Marxist books our intellectuals have gained some understanding through

close contact with the masses of workers and peasants and through their own

practical work, we will all be speaking the same language, not only the common

language of patriotism and the common language of the socialist system, but

probably even the common language of the communist world outlook. If that

happens, all of us will certainly work much better.
